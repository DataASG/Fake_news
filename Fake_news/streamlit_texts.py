explanation = 'Our model has been developed using deep learning alogorithms, specifically an LSTM (Long short-term memory) RNN architecture :robot_face: :sign_of_the_horns:.   \n Our model has been trained on large, publicly available, datasets to differentiate between legitimate news and news designed to deceive (also called disinformation). The latest version of our model currently scores 92% accuracy, this means that this model can correctly classify news articles in over 9 times out of 10.  \n We take your text input :memo:, preprocess its content and let our powerful and trained neural network predict whether the text most likely contains real or fake news :white_check_mark:'
