5085,"An open letter from Vladislav Krasnov, Ph.D. and Obama's official reply","Mon, 24 Oct 2016 00:00 UTC © Fitzgerald Griffin Foundation/Russia Insider President Obama, Vladislav Krasnov, Ph.D An Open Letter to Barack Obama Dear Mr. President: As your presidential duties will soon expire, I want you make sure your Nobel Peace Prize is deserved: Please instruct your officials to return to the path of negotiations with Russia , be it the Syrian crisis, the lapse of the plutonium nuclear arms control deal or Ukraine. By so doing, you will bequeath to your successor —whomever it might be— a solid foundation on which to build a healthier and more peaceful Planet Earth. The United States should re-commit to the policy of non-interference in domestic affairs abroad that our Founding Fathers consistently proclaimed and adhered to. Instead of imposing our cherished values of ""free-market"" and ""democracy"" abroad, let us rely on the wisdom of a man who risked the reputation of a ""traitor"" when he defied King George's war on American colonies. I am talking about Edmund Burke, the British philosopher and father of modern conservatism. Like ancient Greeks he argued that each country is entitled to its own form of government, be it democracy, republic, monarchy, tyranny or despotism, each of which tend to evolve into its opposite. Therefore, the colonies do not have to bow to the King. Burke's monument now graces Washington DC. In respect to Russia, remember that Empress Catherine the Great refused King George's request to send Russian Cossacks help him quell George Washington's rebellion. During the Civil War, while Europe's powers-- Great Britain, France, and Spain—tried to take advantage of President Lincoln's problems with the South, Tsar Alexander II who had just abolished serfdom in Russia, sent Russian Navy to the harbors of New York and San Francisco as a gesture of Good Will. More recently, in spite of the USSR's unconcealed hostility to ""Capitalist"" America, the two countries were able to co-operate in the defeat of Nazi Germany and Japan, and then keep the bitterness of Cold War in check. After 1991, the Communist Russia is no more. The New Russia has been espousing the same values of private property, free enterprise, multi-party free elections, secular government, and freedom of speech and religion— as we do. To be sure, the post-1991 Russian road has been rocky, but this because we meddled on the side of the Russian oligarchs and because it takes years and decades to cultivate free enterprise and democracy in a country that had none for 73 years. In late 1980s, when I was writing Russia Beyond Communism: A Chronicle of National Rebirth (Westview Press, 1991), Soviet soldiers were forbidden to wear crucifix. Now General Sergei Shoigu, Russia's Minister of Defense, would not enter the Red Square without crossing himself publicly. President Vladimir Putin is regularly seen in a church in front of an icon and has addressed Russian Muslims in a mosque and Jews in a synagogue. It's a truly tectonic shift in global affairs since the end of the Cold War in 1991. Therefore, I say, Mr. President, take a breath of fresh air and do what it takes to make your Nobel Peace Prize count: Leave the legacy of peace-seeking negotiations with Russia from which your successor will not deviate lest he or she be called an abominable war monger. More than any other two countries, Russia and the United States are called upon safeguard Peace, Freedom and Commerce not just from San Francisco to Vladivostok, but on the entire Planet Earth. So help us God! Sincerely, W George Krasnow, Ph.D. (aka Vladislav Krasnov) President, RAGA.org October 10, 2016 W. George Krasnow (also published as Vladislav Krasnov), Ph.D., runs the Russia and America Goodwill Association, a non-profit organization of Americans for friendship with Russia. Formerly, he was a professor and director of Russian Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California.

38787,U.S. preparing plan to draw down embassy staff in Havana: sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is crafting a plan for a drawdown of staff from the American embassy in Havana in response to still-unexplained incidents that have harmed the health of some U.S. diplomats there, U.S. and congressional officials said on Thursday. The State Department’s plan, which was being finalized and could be announced within days, would call for the departure of non-essential staff and diplomats’ families, the sources said. But it was unclear whether leaving the island would be voluntary or compulsory, and one U.S. official said some details were still being worked out. U.S. officials say 21 U.S. diplomats and family members have been afflicted by health problems of unknown origin, including hearing loss, dizziness and nausea. Several Canadians have also been affected in Cuba, a Canadian official has said. The Cuban government has denied any role and is conducting an investigation. But it has so far said it has been unable to determine the cause. Proposals for a drawdown have moved forward since  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the case, which has been threatening the already fragile detente between the two former Cold War foes. The State Department is expected to stop short of saying it will close the recently reopened embassy because of the mysterious affair, despite Tillerson having said last week that such a move was under consideration. But a partial evacuation, even one depicted by the Trump administration as a safety measure, would also send a message of U.S. displeasure over Cuba’s handling of the matter and deliver another blow to Obama-era engagement policies with Havana. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters Thursday that Tillerson – who is now on his way to Beijing - was reviewing all of his options for “how to best protect our American personnel” in Cuba and that she was not ready to announce any decision. But congressional staffers were briefed on the plan on Thursday, two congressional sources said. Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, a harsh critic of the Cuban government, hinted at the State Department’s coming decision. “Any reduction of Americans from @USEmbassyHavana should also require equal number of Castro employees leaving regime’s embassy in U.S.,” he said in a message on Twitter. The State Department declined comment. McClatchy news service was the first to report this week that the United States would soon begin a major withdrawal of Havana staff. Depending on how many diplomats leave, the Havana embassy – the main point of contact for U.S. citizens visiting the island as well as American companies doing business there –  could be left with more of a skeletal staff to handle responsibilities. Though Washington has not cast direct blame on Cuban authorities, the State Department said Tillerson reminded Rodriguez at Tuesday’s meeting of Cuba’s obligation to protect diplomats and their families. In the highest-level U.S.-Cuba meeting since President Donald Trump took office, Rodriguez warned the United States against taking hasty decisions and urged Washington to cooperate with its ongoing investigation. Washington earlier this year expelled two Cuban diplomats over the alleged incidents. The case has brought simmering tensions between the two countries since Trump took office to the boil. Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama, called the Cuban government “corrupt and destabilizing” in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last week. He said he would not lift the U.S. trade embargo on the Caribbean island until it made “fundamental reforms.” Cuba described his comments as “unacceptable and meddling.” ",0
14383,Forgotten No Longer: Pennsylvania Breitbart Readers Praise Trump Paris Decision,"Several Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM listeners from Pennsylvania called in to host Joel Pollak on Friday to express their support for President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords. [Caller Ken said, “I used to work in a coal mine. Coal operators, their biggest fear and why they’re afraid to make major investments, is because they’re afraid the Democrats will get back in office and all their investments will be wasted. And that’s the biggest inhibitor to growth right now. ”  Caller Westin said of the climate accord, “The one thing we’re missing, it’s done with malice. This isn’t bad policy by making a mistake. It’s bad policy by choice and purpose. We have to look at what is their objective. Their objective is to pass money around, redistribute wealth, of course. But the real diabolical purpose is to crush the middle class in this country. ” Westin also pointed to the   backlash against the middle class for voting for Trump. Chris, calling from Pennsylvania, said, “All of these deals, it seems as if they work against the United States, our industry, etc. ” He added, “Mr. Trump, yesterday, talked about all of the negative things that would happen to various sectors in the economy, and my point is, these   left people, lefties, who rabidly support all these accords, I would think they would know what’s going on on the inside. And then as soon as Obama says, ‘Oh, yeah, we’re on board,’ perhaps they are shorting a portfolio of energy companies, for instance, or mining companies. ” Chris suggested, “They take their money and run. Then we’re left holding the bag. ” Caller Louis said he liked to call global warming “global communism. ” “It’s a redistribution of wealth,” said Louis, “of them taking the money to give it to their good old boy system, mostly to people like Al Gore and whoever they arranged to take the money. And I don’t think that taxpayers should take this on our shoulders so a bunch of guys can drive around in nice cars. He also said people need to look at the science and not the hype and that the climate has always been changing and will continue to change, regardless of what man does.

47854,German minister warns on Washington trip against 'politics of fear',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Germany’s foreign minister warned during a trip to Washington on Tuesday about a rise in the use of populist fear tactics by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic, describing this as a threat to Europe, the United States and transatlantic relations. Speaking at George Washington University on Super Tuesday, the biggest single day of state-by-state presidential nominating contests, Frank-Walter Steinmeier did not refer to Donald Trump or other candidates by name but he said he was concerned about the tone of the U.S. campaign. “In Germany and in Europe, something is gaining momentum in our domestic politics - and to be honest, I am also seeing it here in the United States during the primary campaigns. It’s the politics of fear,” Steinmeier said. Politicians in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have watched nervously as businessman and reality TV star Trump has moved from a long shot to the front-runner among Republicans seeking the party’s nomination to run in the Nov. 8 general election. Trump has described Chancellor Angela Merkel’s welcoming policy towards refugees as “insane” and predicted it would cause rioting in Germany. He has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been at odds with Europe since Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region two years ago. Germany does not face a federal election until next year. But a new anti-immigrant party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has emerged as a threat to Merkel’s conservatives. The AfD wants Germany to shut its border to migrants and use force to repel them if necessary. “They pretend that we can seal ourselves off and leave the world outside to deal with its own problems. But that’s wrong,” Steinmeier said, referring to politicians in Europe and the United States. “The worst thing we could do is seal ourselves off,” he said. In a subtle dig at Trump, who has promised to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and make the Mexicans pay for it, the German foreign minister added: “So if you ask me: building walls is a very bad idea - no matter who pays for them.” ",0
31416,HOLY MOLY! TRUMP GIVES EPIC News Conference…SLAYS PRESS…Dresses Down CNN…”Your Ratings Are Lower Than Congress…Network Is All About “Hate” [VIDEO],"During Trump s press conference today, Jim Acosta of CNN bombarded him with one question after another. Trump responded to his dishonest network by calling out the  HATRED and VENOM  he constantly sees on CNN. Acosta pressed on and asked yet another question. Trump responded:  We do have other people and your ratings aren t as good as the others.  Trump told Acosta,  I think you would do much better by being different. I m not ranting and raving. I m just telling you your dishonest people. I m changing it from  fake news  to  very fake news.'  Acosta asked Trump if he is undermining news by calling it  fake news?  Trump response was perfect, as he replied,  I know what s good and I know what s bad, because I m there. So it s very important to me. I want to see an honest press. It s very important to the public to get an honest press. If you were straight and really told it like it was, I would be your biggest fan if you treated me right, including negative stories about me. But when story after story about me is bad, I won! You ve got to be a little bit fair. But when you take a look at some of your stories, and the bias and the hatred. The public is smart and they see it. The whole Russian thing it s a ruse ",1
6723,"Before the Wedding, a Test: 3,000 Miles of Barbecue - The New York Times","We’d drive southwest on Interstate 81, eating barbecue until we hit Memphis. The idea was juvenile in its simplicity, but amid planning a wedding and being a month from turning 30, something juvenile and simple was what I craved. I am a native New Yorker, in a family of waning Italian heritage, so my opinions on barbecue have been treated as an eccentricity. Was my hot dog no good? Perhaps I’d like a burger instead? To my fiancée, Mary Beth,   and North   I was eccentric only in the wide tent I pitched for smoked meat. To most anyone from the Piedmont Crescent in North Carolina, barbecue is not a style of cooking it’s a specific dish: chopped pork topped with a spicy vinegar sauce. Zeal for such a noble meal is only appropriate in her eyes. Ribs, however, are not barbecue. Ribs are ribs. Beef is a wholly different dish. And God help those   South Carolinians, with their heathenous   condiments. Our first stop would be in the heart of Pennsylvania. Criticism was swift from the left side of the aisle. “That’s too far north for good barbecue,” Mary Beth’s family told me. But that was the point of the trip: to prove that barbecue, though miraculous, is not a miracle of geography. My own family was critical for another reason: why spend vacation days driving all the way to Tennessee, and not just fly to a beach? Regardless, Mary Beth was (inexplicably) enthusiastic about splitting a   drive with me, so she’s clearly the best person I know. The trip felt like a fitting stress test before we would vow to share the rest of our lives with each other. Outside of Harrisburg, past an overgrown football field, we found ShakeDown BBQ. A huge   grill on wheels had been wrapping the building in apple wood smoke for hours. I’m a sucker for a wood log fire, but I knew that wouldn’t guarantee good food. Behind a small counter was a towering blackboard detailing the owner’s newest sandwich creations. Rules are anathema to road trips, but I felt it important to lay out some guidelines, if only to focus the debate. Guideline No. 1: If the restaurant offered a sampler or combo platter, we should order it. Guideline No. 2: Pork products would be our focus of scrutiny. We expected few joints east of the Mississippi would hazard an attempt at   brisket. Guideline No. 3: Our highest priority for sides would be beans and greens, the true destiny of those overdone nubs of barbecued meat called burnt ends. Not every restaurant seasons its greens with burnt ends but I imagined that a week of nonstop barbecue, without vegetables, could put us at a legitimate risk for scurvy. We began to deviate from guideline No. 2 on our first stop. ShakeDown’s pulled pork was easily overshadowed by a dark beef brisket. But the pork sausage was the obvious breakout: sweet, robust and right at home between two sides of a bun. The platter had been dusted with a chile and spice blend, and the beans were  . The meal had a very earthy profile, nontraditional for barbecue, at least from a Southerner’s perspective  —   but perhaps not to the area’s German descendants. And there were sauces aplenty: “Regular” Tennessee sauce a very “Spicy” variant a   “Carolina” and a “Creamy Carolina” dipping sauce, seemingly inspired by white coleslaw. More accurate than most tests, the selection of the house sauces, we would find, was the best sign of good barbecue. Shakedown’s lineup scratched every itch I had, but my resident Carolinian thought that most of their sauces were approximated facsimiles. Just over the border in Maryland, in Hagerstown, we stopped at the coyly named Hempen Hill BBQ, a sprawling sports bar crowded with folks looking to cure the munchies. It would be one of the only restaurants on our trip with a wait. The menu tries to do a bit of everything, from   crab chips (hey, it’s Maryland) to smoked prime rib (too large to finish, though we tried). Here, too, the pork sausage (a new menu item, our server told us) outclassed all other offerings: skin crisped from fire, a soft and savory interior, and arresting flavor. But even with three house sauces, an exemplary pork sandwich eluded us. The following morning, we arrived in Virginia. Down the street from the Museum of the Shenandoah Valley, a lovely collection of galleries and gardens, we found Bonnie Blue Southern Market  Grocery in Winchester. The roadside cafe and bakery is in a renovated auto body garage, with plenty of indoor and outdoor tables, all painted fire engine red. Route 81 hadn’t carried us far enough south for the kielbasa not to be a standout: The biscuits and gravy were a tremendous   meal. But now the pulled pork was getting serious: juicy, smoky, a balancing act between salt and spices. The beans practically included a second helping of pork, and the greens, tangy and tender, were the best of the trip. Spirits high, we turned off to travel a strip of the Blue Ridge Parkway, a treasure in itself. The campsites that service motorcades of picnickers are equipped with public grills, and they would see a lot of use once the leaves turned. At over 5, 000 feet, with the air so big and thin, folks would smell your dinner a mile away, and it made me wonder if hospitality is knowing you should expect company. Was barbecue first defined only by its open, inviting aroma? If so, my family’s hot dogs and hamburgers might not be off the mark after all. No guest goes hungry in my mother’s house. Driving down the mountain, we stopped at BeamMeUp BBQ, found in a little beige house on the far edge of Lexington, Va. The last rack of ribs walked out the door before we could order, a disappointment but also a good sign. This was the first pulled pork to make Mary Beth give that signature giddy smile. The pulled meat had great texture and, even before sauces, a complex flavor. The brisket, gleaming like a slab of petrified wood, dissolved instantly upon first bite. That texture doesn’t come without a robust knowledge of temperature, salt and even humidity. The house’s classic “Carolina” sauce was an obvious match for the pork, but the “dark and spicy” sauce ruled the brisket. Nearer the state border, we were surprised by the South Carolina expats at Due South Pit Cooked BBQ in Christiansburg, Va. The interior was    pig tchotchkes and punny pig shirts for sale  —   even the bathroom has a framed pig painting. We were aware of the unofficial rule that a barbecue restaurant must have on premises at least one anthropomorphized pig. This was something else. But Due South was the most committed to sauces of any restaurant on our route, with five bottles at every table: Kansas City “Sweet Brown,” Tennessee “Sweet Red,” spicy “Hot Red,” tangy “Lexington,” and their home state’s mustard “Yellow. ” Nearly all of them were delicious (the sweet brown was too heavy with molasses) but the yellow was Due South’s prodigal sauce. Mary Beth, staring down her state’s rival, wasn’t having any of this mustard stuff. But both sides are guilty of dogmatism: Stephen Colbert, a proud South Carolinian, once suggested that North Carolina’s Piedmont vinegar sauce is better employed as a toilet bowl cleaner. I blanketed my brisket in smoky mustard and, yellow lips and all, offered a satisfied grin. “Well, it’s different if you put it on brisket,” she argued. So the wedding was still on. After days of travel, we finally entered Mary Beth’s home turf: the Piedmont Crescent. I had been surprised by how many restaurants strained themselves to serve every cut, every sauce, every regional quirk their customers might desire. Lexington Barbecue in Lexington, N. C. is on a different level: The   pork shoulder can be sliced, chopped or coarsely chopped, and a laboratory of condiments (“smokehouse” sauce, Texas Pete, Tabasco   …    ) is on every table. The decades appear to have taught Lexington not to argue the details with barbecue fans. But the details are what make Lexington so good. The sandwich itself was a   act of sweet, tangy, tender, smoky, spicy, and even crunchy from the slaw. It’s a joy as simple as it is complex. Farther west, into the North Carolina Appalachians, is Countryside Barbeque in Marion. The restaurant usually has a booth available and, if not, there are rocking chairs on the porch for taking in the mountain air. Like the one at Lexington Barbecue, the pork sandwich rules the menu at Countryside. When the neon “RIBS” sign is on, you’ll know you’re in luck it’s the only item that   the sandwich. While Countryside’s meat isn’t quite as perfected as Lexington’s, its three house sauces are    —   in our case, literally. Years ago, Mary Beth invited me on a trip to the Carolinas and insisted on lunch at Countryside, an old family tradition. She would later tell me, “Only someone who loved you could watch you inhale that rack of ribs and still want to go home with you. ” Some couples have their song Countryside’s Western Carolina is our sauce. We fell in love to that sauce. Barbecue fans will understand. Cars are always   around mealtime at the Original Ridgewood Barbecue in Bluff City, Tenn. not easily done at a big restaurant in a small town of about 1, 700 residents. The restaurant, run almost entirely by women, serves smoked hams, sliced and then crisped on a griddle in the open kitchen. The house sauce is aggressively sweet without tasting imbalanced. The beans are a must, balanced with onion and celery, a   recipe served in cute brown crocks. While waiting to pay for our meal at the register, I let out a sigh of satisfaction. “I know that noise,” said the very tall man next to me. We stood together and chuckled. That’s good barbecue: It’s simple, easy to enjoy and it makes us all neighbors. Near a small marina on the outskirts of Knoxville, we hit Sweet P’s BBQ and Soul House. No musicians were playing that day, but the signs and extra bar made it clear the “Soul House” wasn’t for kicks. The pork and brisket in the sampler were delicious but the ribs were masterfully laid with flavor, a smack in the face with a “Welcome to Tennessee” sign. Dusted with cracked pepper, large sugar granules and dark paprika, there was no need for sauce  —   though we tried it anyway. The “Hot,” a combination of its “Piedmont” sauce and a chipotle purée, was heaven or heatstroke. I didn’t care which. Here we lost guideline No. 3: beans and greens. Mary Beth and I decided instead to cool off with banana pudding. It was so good, we detoured for seconds on our drive back home. In the car, we marveled at the endless mountains and sang along to our favorite musicians from the region (Gabe Dixon and Delta Rae). The rest of the time we talked barbecue. Comparing joints was difficult. Nearly every spot had some breakout dish, and it turned each new menu into a treasure map: What was going to wow us next? The most interesting note our conversations found was how some spots, especially in North Carolina, seemed to intentionally serve slightly dry meat, so as to help it absorb a sauce. Indeed, more than a few restaurants seemed to serve a meat just to have something for the sauce to go on. The biggest disappointment was that, despite no small amount of agony over sauces and meats and wood smoke, few restaurants could be bothered to use   buns. Not so in Nashville. There, we visited with Mary Beth’s cousin, who pointed us toward Edley’s    on 12 South. Befitting its location in the home of country music, the large renovated garage is done up with warm wood beams and benches, hanging lights and pumping music. Despite such a polished experience and   service, the prices were no higher than the roadside places we’d grown accustomed to. A rib’wich was offered as the daily special, something I didn’t expect to find on this trip, so there went our last surviving guideline: order the combo. There were no regrets. The buttered bun was plated to the side to showcase two delicately fried pickles atop a chewy pile of burnt ends  —   an   meal. Mary Beth kept to her pulled pork, which also emphasized those burnt ends. The cost of managing smoke in an urban area can be huge. In Memphis, Charlie Vergos’ Rendezvous is able to operate next to a   and that’s because they serve charbroiled ribs much less smoke required. If any concession had to be made to my hypothesis about geography, it was that cities and barbecue have an    relationship. Or at least they did. Now, even that barrier has fallen. Martin’s    Joint opened a downtown Nashville event space in August and Sweet P’s opened a second location last year in downtown Knoxville. But some of the best barbecue hasn’t moved from its original spot. Scott’ ’s Barbeque in Lexington, Tenn. didn’t look like much but, at that point, we hadn’t seen a Lexington we didn’t like. A   sign out front still showed the 1980 “Coke Is It” slogan. And they still meant it: There was not a sweet tea to be had, but plenty of Pibb Xtra, Mello Yello and other Coke products. Inside is an   refuge from the boiling highway, with big   wood paneling and plenty of   knickknacks. Scott’s pigs are smoked whole hog (think of a luau) then minced, sauced, slapped on a bun, and wrapped like any common deli sandwich. Only that wasn’t a common deli sandwich it gave most of North Carolina a run for its money. The ribs, practically a confit, lacked a spicy bark or crust, but were tremendously tender. Even at 9 in the morning, customers were picking up racks of ribs to serve for lunch. But these were not the dry and spicy Memphis ribs I’d heard of. Had we been driving in the wrong direction? Yet soon there we were on Central Avenue, staring down a blue statue of the University of Memphis’s Tom the tiger, which guards Central BBQ. The line was already out the door. Behind the parking lot was a large mural of farm animals playing in a jazz band and inside was    merchandise. Even with the music turned low, the whole joint felt loud. The scant indoor seating filled up quickly, so we ate under a tent rigged with water misters to allay the   heat. The pork and brisket were great, but the ribs, dry and red as Australia’s Simpson Desert, were clearly the best:   tender with a rolling spiciness. Across town is the    Shop. A bar and grill tucked into a mostly residential block on Madison Avenue, it was quiet for lunch but would attract a crowd for dinner. The waiters knew to push their claim to fame: barbecue spaghetti, basically a sweet and meaty pasta Bolognese. Even after a week of solid barbecue, it was still a pleasure to eat, if a guilty one. Like Lexington’s chopped pork,    Shop’s ribs were another   act of flavors and textures. Sauce might have been the main draw in the Carolinas, but the    Shop produces such a perfect rack of meat, sauce is rather unnecessary, almost unwelcome. It was the end of our trip, but I wanted to keep driving west. To have a grand barbecue road trip that didn’t even enter Missouri or Texas   …     what would people say? It had begun to rain aggressively after we left the    Shop, but I drove us out to the Memphis Riverfront. Parked in front of the Mississippi, I began to lay out Barbecue Road Trip Part 2 and the idea that maybe we should hit a few spots in Alabama? I mean, the state border is right there. Mary Beth just smiled at me. I think she knew that after a week of barbecue, I was all talk, and once our last plate of ribs kicked in, I couldn’t manage much talking either. We were tired and we were full and all we really wanted to do was go home and get married. So we did.",0
31230,HILARIOUS! Look Who LIBERAL Middlebury Professor Is Blaming After She Was Sent To Hospital By Angry Mob Of Leftist Students,"Two weeks ago at Middlebury College, Charles Murray needed a safe space   literally.In a significant escalation of the campus speech wars, protesters hooted down the conservative scholar in a lecture hall and then roughed up a Middlebury faculty member escorting him to a car.The Middlebury administration commendably tried to do the right thing and stand by Murray s right to be heard, but was overwhelmed by a yowling mob with all the manners and intellectual openness of a gang of British soccer hooligans.The students who brought in Charles Murray framed the evening as  an invitation to argue,  and in that spirit asked Professor Allison Stanger, a Democrat in good standing, to serve as Murray s interlocutor. When chanting students commandeered the lecture hall, Stanger and Murray repaired to another room for a livestreamed discussion.Protesters found the room and pounded on the windows and pulled fire alarms. When Murray and Stanger exited at the end of the livestream and headed for their getaway car, protesters assailed them. They shoved and grabbed Stanger, who was shaken up and later went to the hospital, and pounded on the car and tried to obstruct it. She was recently diagnosed with a concussion that she suffered during the liberal beating by Middlebury students.Stanger wrote afterward that she  feared for my life. And for what offense? Talking to someone who thinks differently than the average Middleburg faculty member or student.Allison Stanger invited Charles Murray, famous for The Bell Curve, to speak at the school. Students were so outraged Murray had to flee for his life, and Stanger got beaten up. Her response?It s Trump s fault!During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, student Red Guards forced professors to make self-confessions. This situation was clearly different, however, as most of the students were not Chinese.Stanger is smart. She doesn t have to deal with Donald Trump at her school, but she does have to deal with her fellow leftist faculty members and leftist students. She s trying to make kissy-kissy with them so they don t smack her in the head again.If I were in her position, I d probably do the same thing. On the other hand, Vermont is a concealed carry state, so maybe there could be another option when faced with a life-threatening leftist mob.Exit question:1) When someone goes to an emergency room with throbbing head pains and a hardcore leftist worldview, how can an E.R. doctor determine whether the patient has a head injury or simply a very rigid ideological point of view?   American ThinkerSo in summary, the leftist professor who s made it her mission to indoctrinate Middlebury students, is now blaming President Trump because those same students she encouraged to think and behave like leftists, behaved in a way that is compatible with how leftists behave.  Using  violence and threatening behavior to get your way and drown out the opposing voices is nothing new for leftists, they ve just taken it a significant notch since Obama took office 8 years ago.

Ignorant, but cheap as dirt to hire.  Robert Tracinski (@Tracinski) May 20, 2016In going through these tweets, one will see some predictably sexist tweets about how it s just as sexist for a company to have an entirely female leadership staff as it is for them to have an entirely male leadership staff. That s male privilege talking, though   we still live in a man s world here. Women have it much harder in the workplace, including climbing that vaunted corporate ladder, than men do.An all-female editorial team in a man s world is great. However, for a supposedly liberal outlet, whatever attempts they re making at racial diversity suck. We have to wonder whether their HR department screens out resumes of people with  black  sounding names like many other HR departments do. We also have to wonder whether they consider black people to automatically be less qualified, like many other companies seem to.Perhaps they re afraid they ll lose readers if their readers know they have black people on their editorial staff.Yes, companies should absolutely put the people they believe to be the best qualified in open positions. Oftentimes, however, black candidates are judged more harshly than other candidates, especially white candidates, due to racial biases in a variety of areas. HuffPo, this is extremely disappointing.Image via screen capture from embedded tweet by Liz Heron",1

52347,Spanish court orders release on bail for Catalan parliament speaker: court source,"MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish Supreme Court judge on Thursday ordered the Catalan parliament speaker be released on bail of 150,000 euros ($174,615) pending an investigation into her role in Catalonia s banned push for independence, a court source said. The speaker, Carme Forcadell, will be held in custody until she pays the bail, the source said. Forcadell and five regional lawmakers testified on Thursday on charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds. Four other lawmakers would also be released on 25,000-euro bail, while a fifth would be freed on certain conditions without bail, the source said. Spain s prosecutor had previously requested jail for Forcadell and three lawmakers summoned to the Supreme Court and the release of two others on certain conditions.  ",0

42778,"U.S., Japan first ladies: both unconventional yet poles apart","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Japanese first lady Akie Abe made her rounds in Washington on Friday, noticeably absent was the high-level chaperone of previous visits - America’s first lady. Rather than Melania Trump, it was the wife of the Japanese ambassador to the United States who accompanied Akie Abe on a visit to a local university, a Japanese embassy official said. That was a departure from Akie Abe’s previous visits to Washington. In 2007, she was treated to a tour with Laura Bush to George Washington’s home, Mount Vernon, and in 2015, she and Michelle Obama stopped by a northern Virginia elementary school with a Japanese immersion program. The break with convention, three weeks into husband Donald Trump’s presidency, is another sign that Melania Trump may have different designs on the first lady’s role than her predecessors.    Melania Trump has elected to stay in New York for now while her son finishes his school year. It is not yet clear if she will take a prominent role in White House social events, including accompanying fellow first ladies on their visits to the capital.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife are scheduled to spend the weekend at the Trumps’ Florida Mar-a-Lago retreat, where the two leaders will golf and the task of hosting Mrs. Abe will fall to Melania. While their husbands strive to appear in lock-step on U.S.-Japan relations this weekend, Melania Trump may find in her Japanese counterpart someone who is in many ways her opposite - a political spouse who does not shun the limelight and disagrees publicly with her powerful husband. Melania Trump, a former model from Slovenia, rarely airs differences of opinion with her husband. Akie Abe, in contrast, has used news interviews to make policy recommendations for his administration, leading some to dub her the “household opposition.”  She told Reuters in 2014 that Japan should consider cutting spending and boosting the economy before further raising the sales tax, to 10 percent. She said she had urged her husband not to go forward with the first stage of the rise, to 8 percent, to no avail.  Critiquing Japan’s male-dominated professional culture, Akie Abe told Bloomberg last year that Japanese women are held back by pressure from men to be “cute” rather than “capable and hardworking.” Her public profile makes her a rarity in Japan as well as a stark contrast with Melania Trump, who largely avoided the campaign trail, has not shown deep interest in public policy, and has rarely disagreed with Trump in public despite some damaging revelations. When a videotape of Trump emerged during the 2016 presidential campaign in which he boasted about grabbing women by their genitals, Melania said in a brief statement that his words were “unacceptable and offensive” but that she had accepted his apology.     The differing styles could keep the weekend conversations on the light side. “I would certainly expect no discussion of global politics” between Melania and Akie, said Jean Harris, a University of Scranton professor who has studied the role of first ladies. “I don’t see Melania as wanting to be part of those conversations.” Akie Abe’s openness in stating points of disagreement with her husband has few parallels even in American politics, where first ladies tend not to diverge from their husbands in public, though they may be crucial advisors behind the scenes, Harris said. Just after the election, Melania Trump said in a CBS interview that she chides her husband “all the time” for his Twitter attacks. “Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn’t,” she said. “I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.” ",0

2175,Rhymes with hypocrisy,"Posted on October 31, 2016 by Frank Scott 
“The greatest objective of mankind in this century should be to eradicate imperialism and capitalism as models for society.”—Evo Morales 
As we approach the end of our most recent contamination of the ideal of national democracy with possibly its worst example we would do well to consider the words of a democratically elected leader of a nation that could teach us about the word’s meaning. 
A representative of the real majority of his people, a former farm worker who rose to the presidency on the shoulders of ordinary Bolivians and not the bank books of his nation’s rich, Evo Morales and his supporters understand more about the state of the world than many of us understand about the state of our nation. Whichever of the ruling parties’ unpopular wretches is elected on November 8, they will contradict Morales’s words, possibly with more savagery than ever before, and the need for a political economic transformation of America and the world will become greater than ever before. 
Our ruling oligarchs have reacted with a vengeance in suppressing two dangerously democratic threats to their dominance. First, Bernie Sanders leading a popular movement motivated by social desire, and second a more ego centered individualist struggle led by an economic billionaire and intellectual pauper, usually a winning combination in the empire of capital but not this time. In fact, the populace has received daily bulletins about Donald Trump’s outrageous practice of capitalism and its profitable by-products of division by dollar, race and sex. Who knew? 
If we are to believe polls which measure how much we absorb the message of our consciousness controllers, the assault on our collective mentality has never been as blatant, corrupt, single minded and seemingly successful; we will soon coronate a historic first for the empire as the glass ceiling above the CEO presiding over the slaughters perpetrated by our warfare state will be broken and a woman will lead the foreign policy that creates many people of color: blood red. 
The further destruction of the Muslim world and the creation of more terrorists who murder us because we murder them will continue. Heart breaking photos of a Palestinian, Yemeni, Iraqi or Syrian parent carrying what used to be a son or daughter, reduced to a bloody pulp form of unidentifiable gender fluidity by an Israeli, French, British or German aimed, American created bomb, will not go viral. Only those dramatic and sometimes staged photos of alleged victims of America’s adversaries are assured such coverage, while we beseech one and all to take in refugees created by our destruction of their nations. 
Frighteningly worse for all of us than terrorist attacks would be a nuclear war that could happen if Russia reacts with as much arrogance and stupidity as the USA and responds to menacing provocation on its borders to enter such a confrontation that could spell the end of everything. 
Hopefully, there will be enough Americans who identify with humanity’s wholeness and refuse forced acceptance of membership in a fictitious minority with warped identity sense that makes it somehow less or more politically correct by having different genitals, skin tones or belief systems and remaining oblivious to being members of the one and only race: human. 
Historic problems dating back to the nation’s origins in being brutally stolen from the original inhabitants, built on slave and indentured servant labor abused in order to create wealth enough to trickle down on what many of the descendants found a middle class status in a dream society that offered material hope to many but depended on continued exploitation of many more to maintain a lie. We are a nation built at the expense of the semi-voluntary poor thrown out of Europe, Asia and Africa to become supporters of a national dream nearing a nightmare for too many and needing a wakeup call from the world, in the words of Morales. 
Government of the people, by the people, for the people, our supposed ideal, obviously has nothing to do with the present owned and operated by great wealth entity that can be defined as democracy the way that rape can be defined as love. But as long as great wealth maintains dominance and keeps democratic power from the rest of us in part by controlling what we think we know, genuine concern about government can be played as a skirmish between the supporters of a market without any control and supporters of a market with minimal control, both assuring that wealth will be defended, only differing in how much of it will accrue to the minority rulers, how quickly it will occur and how acceptable that will be found by the poorly informed. 
Neither government nor banking nor finance will work for the majority of the people until the people create democracy in deed as opposed to the sham we have. As long as minorities, growing smaller in number as their private wealth grows larger, are allowed to dominate there is no difference between modern capitalism and ancient feudalism. We now tolerate billionaires whose material wealth and power would stagger some phony royal/god/pharaoh of the ancient past and our innumeracy in failing to understand that—how the hell does anyone have a billion dollars while more than a billion humans survive (?) on not much more than a couple of dollars a day?—while we are fed a steady diet of consumerist garbage by these rulers can only change when we grow angry enough at what is happening to the planet we live on and most of its people by having it and us treated as products in a free market where nothing is free, all to benefit them while we carry the ever more staggering cost. For openers, we ought not to vote for the lesser evil deadly duo but the greater good of Jill Stein and the Greens and then join any group opting for change that is systemic and not simply individual.

46716,Oklahoma governor vetoes bill to jail abortion doctors,"(Reuters) - Oklahoma’s Republican Governor Mary Fallin vetoed a bill calling for prison terms of up the three years for doctors who performed abortions, saying the legislation would not withstand a criminal constitutional legal challenge, her office said on Friday. The bill, which was approved a day earlier in the Republican-dominated legislature, would have made performing an abortion a felony. It also called for revoking the license of any doctor who conducted one. The bill allowed an exemption for an abortion necessary to save the life of the mother. “The bill is so ambiguous and so vague that doctors cannot be certain what medical circumstances would be considered ‘necessary to preserve the life of the mother,’” Fallin said, in a statement from her office, where she was described as “the most pro-life governor in the nation.” Abortion rights groups had promised a bruising legal battle if the bill were signed into law, which would have resulted in an expensive legal battle.  Cash-strapped Oklahoma is battling a $1.3 billion budget hole that has caused it to cut education funding and other state programs. Had the bill been approved, the state would have been the first to use its codes of professional conduct to implement a measure that would effectively serve as an abortion ban, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which backs abortion rights but whose data is used by both sides of the debate. Other states that have tried to impose outright abortion bans after the Supreme Court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision have seen their laws struck down by courts, it said. Supporters have said the bill could withstand a legal challenge because the state was within its rights to set licensing requirement for doctors. Legal experts have said the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that abortion is legal in the United States and Oklahoma must abide by the court’s decision. Since Fallin took office in 2011, Oklahoma has been one of the leaders in adding restrictions to abortions. “Governor Fallin did the right thing today in vetoing this utterly unconstitutional and dangerous bill,” said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive officer of the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights group.

44540,Mexico president to show 'pragmatism' dealing with Trump,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico will need to show “enormous pragmatism” in its dealings with Donald Trump’s government, President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Tuesday, as his administration prepares to seek common ground on trade and immigration issues. Mexico is on tenterhooks awaiting the accession of Trump to the U.S. presidency because of his repeated threats on the campaign trail to impose tariffs on Mexican-made goods and seal the country off behind a massive border wall. Acknowledging that Trump’s victory had generated some uncertainty, Pena Nieto reiterated his government would pursue dialogue with the next U.S. government to reach agreements. “We’ll have to work with enormous pragmatism to agree what’s useful and convenient for Mexico and for the whole of North America,” he told a business summit in the central city of Puebla, Mexican headquarters of German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). The Mexican president added that his government was committed to providing macroeconomic stability for investors, listing a flexible exchange rate, central bank independence and a solid banking system among the key planks of his pledge. Concern has been widespread among business leaders and officials in Mexico that Trump could follow through on threats to abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) if he cannot renegotiate it in the United States’ interests. Struck between the United States, Mexico and Canada, NAFTA took effect in 1994 and has been the cornerstone of Mexican international trade policy. Mexico sends four-fifths of its goods exports to the United States. Still, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo believes Trump will not back out of NAFTA, and has said Mexico could add new chapters to the deal to update it. ",0

School Superintendent, John Sills, no employees will face disciplinary action for showing this video to the students. People who are sick and tired of watching our nation being divided down racial lines should call him at 781-275-7588. It s time to flood the lines of these leftist school administrators and let him know how you feel about the shaming of white students in a high school he is paid to supervise.BEDFORD, Mass.   After students played a video promoting racial stereotypes during the morning announcements, school administrators are dismissing it as a  teachable moment. A group of students at Bedford High School who produce  BHS Live  created a video called  Sh*t White People Say,  which played off racial stereotypes allegedly held by their white peers.It featured a black girl wearing a blonde wig, several school employees and a number of minority students.It warns white students to  DO NOT ASSume  things about their black classmates. I m very offended by what I saw,  parent Bob Marshall tells Fox 25.  It was a very disgusting video, very hurtful video. A lot of them were upset by what they saw,  Marshall he says of students who watched it during morning announcements. I m shocked that a video like that could be displayed and that nobody oversaw it. School administrators are pleading ignorance.HERE S THE VIDEO:In a letter home to parents after the incident, the school s principal says,     there has not been a vetting process of videos for BHS Live. Therefore, the video was not previewed by any administrator, student or teacher surrounding BHS Live. A protocol for vetting student videos is being developed. That seems a little hard to believe, given that three adults participated in the production.Superintendent John Sills says while  it was framed in a way that was offensive,  it was a positive thing that the video spurred  conversations. I would never say it s good when something offensive happens. But we always seek to find positives, and we continue to work to derive learning from it,  according to Sills.That s not good enough for Marshall. To me, it s smoke and mirrors to say oh, it was a learning lesson,  Marshall says.  Somebody needs to be held accountable and somebody needs to lose their job over it. According to the superintendent, no employees will face disciplinary action.Via: EAG News",1
31461,"TJ MAXX AND MARSHALLS Tell Employees To Trash Signs For Ivanka Trump Line, Mix Line With General Merchandise"," According to the New York Times, outlet stores T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed their employees to throw away signs for Ivanka Trump s clothing line, and hang her clothes so that they mix in with other lines.The instruction was to eliminate special displays for the merchandise,  not to remove it from the sales floor,  said Doreen Thompson, a spokeswoman for the TJX Companies, the retailers  parent corporation. We offer a rapidly changing selection of merchandise for our customers, and brands are featured based on a number of factors,  she said.The company did not respond to the New York Times query as to whether or not this kind of handling of product was normal, but one employee came forward and told the paper that after several years of being employed with the stores, she had not been instructed to do this before. -The BlazeTJ Maxx and Marshalls corporate headquarters are located in the very liberal city of Farmington, MA.In the 2016 general election, 75 percent of the 39,722 registered voters in Farmington participated in the presidential election.Of those voters, 20,277 voted for Clinton, with 7,031 for Trump. So it should come as no surprise that the people making the decisions on behalf of the stores would send such an outrageous message to their employees that appears to be intended to harm Ivanka Trump s clothing line. For many shoppers like myself, these new developments as they relate to the trashing of Ivanka Trump s clothing and accessory brand really puts a crimp in my shopping patterns at some of my favorite stores, which include Norstrom and TJ Maxx and the TJ Maxx owned Home Goods store. Gone are the days when these kinds of corporate decisions are made and kept under the radar. Trump has an army of exceptionally loyal supporters who are willing to defend him and his lovely family, even if it means we have to do our shopping elsewhere.In a USA Today article, TJ Maxx CEO Ernie Herrman noted,  We are extremely pleased that our comp store sales growth was almost entirely driven by customer traffic.  Your companies recent decision to trash Ivanka Trump s brand in your store may change that Mr. Herrman Here s a letter to TJMaxx CEO from a leftist in VT that was published in the local Mountain Times newspaper. Editors note: the following is an open letter to Ernie Herrman, CEO and president of TJMaxxDear Mr. Herrman,I am writing to tell you that I have stopped shopping in TJMaxx stores since the election in November of 2016. That is when I became aware that you carry Ivanka accessories. I m sure that you have not missed my 100 or so dollars a month that I would usually spend at your store. But I have missed shopping with you. This is probably hurting me more than it is you. But the real hurt is what is being delivered to our nation by Trump.Let me be very clear: The objective of boycotting is not to destroy your business or to cause job losses. The objective is to send a direct message to you, the CEO, to your Board of Directors, and your stockholders that your merchandising choice regarding Ivanka brand goods needs to change.I know that public pressure and consumer spending has a big effect on markets and policy. Just this week, the CEO of Uber resigned from Trump s Economic Advisory Council. Uber profited from continuing service at JFK airport last weekend when all the NYC cabs boycotted the airport in a show of support for the protesters. Consequently, 200,000 customers deleted their Uber accounts. The CEO decided it wasn t economically advantageous to be aligned with the Trump administration.Recently, the retailers: Shoes.com, Neiman Marcus, and Nordstrom s all cancelled their Ivanka fashion and jewellery line because of public outcry and customer boycotts of their stores.In a consumer based economy, our money has power. So I am asking you to cancel your merchandising of Ivanka accessories. Please let me know as soon as possible when you have done this, so that I can resume shopping at my favorite TJMaxx store.In the meantime, I am going to donate the $100.00 I would have spent at your establishment this month to the ACLU, so that green card holders, immigrants and refugees seeking to enter the US can have some legal representation.Sincerely and respectfully, Your Once Loyal Customer,Candy Jones, Rutland ",1

Would he be joining in the boycott he called for? Probably not because he s still using his iPhone to tweet dozens of times a day.

The Justice Department has repeatedly demanded that Apple break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino terrorists.

For users of the Twitter organizational app called Tweetdeck.The Republican front-runner made the comments at a campaign rally in South Carolina where he is expected to win the primary by a massive margin.Trump s attack on Apple is an odd choice for the man who frequently cites his shrewd business sense as his main (some might say  only ) presidential qualifier. It s certainly not about ethics. Trump routinely brags that his companies have declared bankruptcy to exploit the government and make the taxpayers give him more money. Instead, it might just be out of professional jealousy. After all, Trump may be a billionaire, but none of his assets hold a candle to Apple s profitability.Recently, Apple s value surpassed $700 billion, the largest company in the United States by a massive margin. It s unlikely that Trump, or his fans, will have any discernible impact on the company s profits. In the past several years, Republicans have threatened to boycott everything from Starbucks to Cheerios. The half-baked protests have worked exactly zero times. Trump may have the Republican Party under his thumb, but most of America still hates his guts.Feature image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr",1
18159,Genetically Modified Crops in U.S. Fail to Deliver on Promise of Greater Crop Yield and Diminished Pesticide Use,"Trending Articles: Trending Articles: Genetically Modified Crops in U.S. Fail to Deliver on Promise of Greater Crop Yield and Diminished Pesticide Use Published: October 31, 2016 Source: New York Times 
LONDON — The controversy over genetically modified crops has long focused on largely unsubstantiated fears that they are unsafe to eat. 
But an extensive examination by The New York Times indicates that the debate has missed a more basic problem — genetic modification in the United States and Canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides. 
The promise of genetic modification was twofold: By making crops immune to the effects of weedkillers and inherently resistant to many pests, they would grow so robustly that they would become indispensable to feeding the world’s growing population, while also requiring fewer applications of sprayed pesticides. 
Twenty years ago, Europe largely rejected genetic modification at the same time the United States and Canada were embracing it. Comparing results on the two continents, using independent data as well as academic and industry research, shows how the technology has fallen short of the promise. 
An analysis by The Times using U.N. data showed that the United States and Canada have gained no discernible advantage in yields when measured against Western Europe, a region with comparably modernized agricultural producers like France and Germany . Also, a recent National Academy of Sciences report found “there was little evidence” that the introduction of genetically modified crops in the United States had led to yield gains beyond those seen in conventional crops. 
At the same time, herbicide use has increased in the United States, even as major crops like corn, soybeans and cotton have been converted to modified varieties. And the United States has fallen behind Europe’s biggest producer, France, in reducing the overall use of pesticides, which includes both herbicides and insecticides.",1

45265,Cuba welcomes ambassador nomination but says Obama can do more,"HAVANA (Reuters) - President Barack Obama’s nomination of an ambassador to Cuba is welcome but he should still do more to normalize relations between the two countries during his remaining time in office, a senior Cuban government official said on Wednesday. Gustavo Machin, the deputy director for U.S. affairs in the Cuban foreign ministry, told a news conference that Cuba will make those concerns known during a bilateral commission meeting on Friday in Washington. “The Cuban delegation will point out the lack of advances of in the economic, commercial sphere,” Machin said. “We consider the measures adopted by President Obama’s administration are positive but still insufficient and limited.” Obama on Tuesday nominated career diplomat Jeffrey DeLaurentis, the top official at the U.S. Embassy in Havana since relations were restored last year, to be the first U.S. ambassador to Cuba in more than five decades. This was “welcome” news, Machin said. Cuba appointed its ambassador to the U.S. a year ago.  Still, the nomination must be approved by the Republican-controlled Senate, which is seen as a long shot in a presidential election year and given expected strong resistance from Cuban-American senators including Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas. Obama should also use his executive powers, as he has done in the past, to further hollow out the trade embargo imposed on Cuba after its 1959 revolution, Machin said. Only Congress can lift the embargo, and the Republican leadership is not expected to allow such a move anytime soon. “If the president could... allow investment in telecoms, why can’t he authorize investments in other areas?” Machin said.  If he allowed the export of certain Cuban products to the United States, why could he not broaden the export of Cuban products?” Machin asked. Obama’s critics meanwhile accuse him of already making too many concessions towards Cuba without getting enough in return. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said earlier this month that if elected he would seek to reverse the detente unless the leaders there allowed religious freedoms and freed political prisoners. Machin said he hoped the next president would take into account the opinion of the majority of Americans, who agree with the opening to Cuba, according to opinion polls.  Despite the need for more progress still, the two countries have made concrete progress in improving relations over the past four months since a previous commission meeting, Machin said, for example re-launching commercial flights.

18619,CNN’S Tapper: Trump ’Empirically Worse and More Opaque’ Than Obama - Breitbart,"Tuesday on CNN’s “The Lead,” host Jake Tapper said on transparency issues President Donald Trump’s administration is “empirically worse and more opaque. ” than President Barack Obama’s administration was.  Tapper said, “Let’s turn to our politics lead now. This afternoon, Press Secretary Sean Spicer held an   briefing and took reporters’ questions. That is something that in and of itself should not be news, but in this case, it is because the Trump administrators have been keeping reporters at bay for more than a week. In many ways, the Trump administration has been less transparent than its predecessors. Even those who thought the Obama administration never lived up to its ballyhooed promises of transparency, President Obama released his taxes, and President Trump has not released his. ” “President Trump shares literally nothing about who is coming to see him,” he continued. “President Obama golfed quite a bit, as does President Trump, but the Obama house would tell the public when he was hitting the links and with whom. This White House, for whatever reason, keeps that information private. Even the White House briefings are now shorter, with more   and a new trend of not allowing cameras or even audio recordings of what your White House is saying on any given day. People in power like to hide things from the public. We called it out under President Obama, and now it is empirically worse and more opaque. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",0
7474,Madonna and Hillary: ‘Witch’ and ‘Nasty Woman’ as Sisters in Arms - The New York Times,"“I was called a whore and a witch,” Madonna said on Friday in a searing speech about the sexism and bullying that women face in the music industry and the culture at large. “Such a nasty woman,” Donald J. Trump interjected in October as Hillary Clinton pointed out holes in his Social Security plan during their final presidential debate. Madonna and Mrs. Clinton: both trailblazers, both polarizing figures, and both attacked for actions, choices and behavior that are broadly accepted  —   even applauded  —   when done by their male peers. Madonna herself made a connection between the two women before her speech Friday, saying it was “really important to make a stand and speak my mind” about women’s rights after Mrs. Clinton’s loss in November. Our pop music editor, Caryn Ganz, and deputy Culture editor and former political correspondent Patrick Healy looked at how Madonna and her speech put Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy in fresh perspective. PATRICK HEALY: Caryn, I’m coming off 18 months covering the presidential campaign, and frankly I’ve been wondering if Mrs. Clinton would ever give a speech like Madonna’s on Friday  —   calling out sexism in America and the rules that trap women but not men. “If you’re a girl, you have to play the game,” Madonna said. “Don’t have an opinion that’s out of line with the status quo. ” Madonna and Mrs. Clinton have been controversial in part because they didn’t play “the game. ” It’s easy to forget, amid their celebrity and longevity, that Madonna and Mrs. Clinton were once renegades: speaking out and pursuing power in ways that were considered overly ambitious for women. They fought for equality and respect  —   and they sought the kind of influence and money and fame that men have. Mrs. Clinton’s place and legacy in our culture is just starting to be considered and debated. But only after her speech yesterday did I start to think about her and Madonna as sisters in arms. CARYN GANZ: Mrs. Clinton is so buttoned up and Madonna is so, well, unbuttoned, that I think many people have been hesitant to make this connection. And because Madonna has used sexual expressiveness as code for all kinds of liberation, she hasn’t been courted as a political ally. But now that both of them have reached a certain age, the sexism they’ve faced for decades has become something more insidious, paired with ageism. HEALY: A lot of people don’t see sexism hurting Mrs. Clinton  —   after all, she won the Democratic nomination  —   but she and her advisers did. As for the sort of “liberation” that Madonna pioneered, Mrs. Clinton has a complicated relationship with it. She came of age in the era of women’s lib, and yet  —   to help Bill Clinton’s career in Arkansas  —   she changed her last name from Rodham to Clinton and got new hairstyles and glasses. And when she was most visibly liberated, including in her   performances in political debates, she got called “likable enough” by Barack Obama in 2008 and a “nasty woman” by Mr. Trump this fall. Madonna, in her speech Friday, recalled that she got so much abuse after releasing her “Erotica” album and “Sex” book in 1992 that she felt like “the most hated person on the planet. ” GANZ: In a 2008 “Weekend Update” segment about Mrs. Clinton’s initial presidential run, Tina Fey said: “Maybe what bothers me the most is that people say that Hillary is a bitch. Let me say something about that: Yeah, she is. ” (Ms. Fey later proclaimed, “Bitch is the new black. ”) I thought about this when Madonna put the song “Unapologetic Bitch” on her most recent album, “Rebel Heart,” the record where she started to speak openly about the discrimination she’s faced as a female artist over 55. Madonna has referred to herself in many ways in songs over the years, but she waited until 2015, on her 13th album, to reclaim “bitch. ” HEALY: Mrs. Clinton knew some people used that word about her. Like Madonna, she answered the haters with a strong work ethic. Mrs. Clinton put in   days, thought deeply about policy, and was a tireless campaigner even if she wasn’t the world’s most natural politician. Madonna is no Adele: She wasn’t born with a     talent and voice. But she succeeded through work, grit and guts. GANZ: But she was born with a     ability to understand and command the power of connecting her voice to her image. Nobody did this the way Madonna did before her, though many have followed her example. Knowing that as a woman, her appearance would be a talking point, Madonna   this scrutiny as a weapon from the beginning of her career, forcing everyone to talk about what she looked like by evolving  —   it was a conversation she essentially started herself. But as she has gotten older, the commentary about her work is almost entirely centered on how she looks rather than how she sounds, and whether what she is wearing or saying is “appropriate for a woman her age”  —   a question that musicians like Mick Jagger, who is 15 years older than Madonna, have never had to answer. And certainly no other candidate was the subject of stories about what he wore to the debate and what his clothes meant. (Continuing investigations into Mr. Trump’s hair aside.) HEALY: I remember Mrs. Clinton telling me during the 2008 race that she probably woke up two hours earlier than Barack Obama each day because she had to do her hair and makeup, and he could just roll out of bed and into a suit. She has had no room for error in what she says or how she looks, her advisers felt, while a candidate like Mr. Trump could sound like a crazy man on Twitter, and many voters shrugged. Then again, Mrs. Clinton is far more of a perfectionist than Mr. Trump, as is Madonna. GANZ: But Madonna and Mrs. Clinton have had their perfectionism interpreted as a pathology. As women cutting a path no woman had traveled before, they had no choice but to be as precise and   as possible, knowing the slightest failure would invite a deluge of criticism. Madonna is known to control every aspect of rooms in which she will appear, down to the color of the lampshades. While Mr. Trump was making brash statements, Mrs. Clinton was tweeting    policy plans and rigorously preparing for the debates. HEALY: But Mrs. Clinton could also take control too far, like keeping her State Department email on a private server. “I don’t want any risk of the personal being accessible,” she wrote in 2010. And in 2008, she rarely talked about being a woman because she wanted to control her image  —   she wanted voters to think she would be as tough as any male commander in chief. GANZ: Trailblazing is a solitary game. They’re both lonely warriors who reached a critical moment this year: the time when they had to speak up for their achievements and call out their haters. HEALY: As Madonna said in her speech, “I remember wishing I had a female peer I could look to for support. ” But she and Mrs. Clinton have a mixed record as allies of feminists. Mrs. Clinton put aside her career to support her husband’s, and stood by him during his extramarital affairs, and she supported some policies, like a welfare overhaul, that critics regarded as  . She was also a champion of women’s rights as human rights  —   even as she opposed gay rights like   marriage. Do Mrs. Clinton and Madonna bear any responsibility for being polarizing figures, Caryn? GANZ: Oh, certainly, although Madonna has always been a steadfast supporter of gay rights (something Mrs. Clinton can’t claim). Madonna designed herself to be a polarizing figure, and her breed of feminism has evolved over the years  —   at times she’s been more focused on   than the advancement of womankind. She has defended Sean Penn from accusations of domestic abuse. She wrote one of the most famous songs about not having an abortion. And she’s also often been a covert feminist: On “Material Girl,” a song still cited as an ode to consumerism, Madonna is the winner because “experience has made me rich, and now they’re after me. ” It wasn’t the objects she was after, or the men  —   it was the power. And that was in 1984. HEALY: Mrs. Clinton has been labeled   since she was a young woman. And it drove her crazy, advisers said, because Mr. Trump and other men never faced that accusation. She felt held to the double standard that Madonna spoke about on Friday. I can imagine Mrs. Clinton listening to that speech and just saying “Yaaaas” over and over.",0
5853,First Thoughts On The Not-Hillary Election Results,"November 09, 2016 First Thoughts On The Not-Hillary Election Results 
So I just woke up and found that the world has changed. World War III was called off. Trump won, Clinton conceded. His victory speech is fair and integrating. 
My ""not Hillary"" prediction for the election was right. That is, I believe, how Trump won. No so much by gaining genuine votes but by taking them from the crappiest candidate the Democrats could send into the race. This was not a ""white vote"". Trump did better with black (+5) and latino (+2) voters than Romney. Racism does not explain that. Clinton promised more wars. Those who would have to fight them on the ground rejected that position. 
The people voted against corruption, against international warmongering, against attacks of the culture of their life and against Zionist and Arab manipulation. In short - they voted against Hillary. 
The media with their outright and widespread manipulation and one sided reporting against Trump and for Clinton lost too. People did not believe the partisan crap that fact-checked Trump on every minor issue but hardly reported on the huge, huge scandals and corruption Wikileaks revealed about the Clintons. Fact-checkers ain't a good weapon in a culture war. The polls, but the one of the LA Times, turned out to be systematic manipulation. 
The leading politicians in Europe will crap their pants. Nearly all but Putin bet heavily on Clinton. The European media were also strongly pro Clinton, even more so than in the U.S. There was zero reporting about Trump's real political positions and support. Only tiny bits about Clinton's corruption were revealed on the back pages. They always believe what the NYT writes is the essence of U.S. thinking. It is far from it. No one but a few east-coast party goers and the NYT cares about some 16 year old girl, who thinks she is ""transsexual"" and wants to use a men's public toilet. The average people think that such craziness deserves zero attention if not a hefty kick in the ass. Pro-migration and other political correctness movements in Europe will have a difficult stand now. They can no longer work against the instincts of the people by pointing to the soothing, fake words of an Obama or Clinton. 
The Democratic party failed. The outright corruption of the party heads, who pushed Sanders out to move Clinton in by manipulating the primaries, blocked the natural development that went on at the base. They even wanted Trump as a candidate because they though Clinton could easily beat him. They were totally detached from real life. I am sure that post-mortem analysis will show that many, many potential pro-democratic voters were just disgusted and stayed at home or voted for a third party. The establishment of the Republican party were no better. They failed their voters just as much by shunning Trump and working for Clinton. All the neo-cons that flocked to Clinton will now scramble to get back to Trump. They will have little chance. 
But the election also created huge new dangers. People around Trump, including his vice-president, are not sane realist but fairly extreme ideologues. Trump himself isn't. He is, in my estimate, fairly pragmatic. The Republicans also won the Senate and House. There is a danger that extreme policies will be implemented with huge and terrible long-term consequences. But remember that Obama had the same chance in his first two years of his Presidency. He never used it. From a progressive view he blew it. 
Winning back the House and Senate in two years is a must for anyone with some middle-of-the-road thinking. 
I believe that this result is good for Syria and the non-Jihadi and non-Zonist Middle East. Al-Qaeda in Syria will have a sad. Their main supporters leave the stage. The result is likely good for Europe including for Russia. It is bad for economic equality in the United States. 
I for one feel mightily eased. The U.S. voters knocked over a chessboard that brought war and misery to many people. We do not know how the new game will look but I think there is a fair chance now that it, in total, will be somewhat less devastating for the global good.

45447,House panel okays Dodd-Frank revamp amid partisan rancor,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A House of Representatives panel on Tuesday approved a proposal to revamp the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, after a hearing where lawmakers verbally tussled over rules enacted in the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis. The Financial Services Committee voted to send the bill, introduced this summer by committee chairman, Republican Jeb Hensarling, to the full House to consider. No Democrat on the committee voted for the measure, which would allow banks to choose between complying with Dodd-Frank or meeting tougher capital requirements. It would also reorganize the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), a watchdog created through Dodd-Frank that last week penalized Wells Fargo for creating millions of fake accounts under customers’ names. The 2010 Dodd-Frank law, passed in the wake of the financial crisis, has drawn the ire of most banks and Republicans in Congress. They have said Congress went too far in trying to clamp down on Wall Street and the law imposes burdensome requirements and gives regulators too much power. The CPFB has been a particular target for Republicans, who do not like that it is governed by a single director and say it reaches beyond its authority in enforcement. During the hearing, Democrats cited the Wells case, where the CFPB levied its largest-ever fine of $100 million, criticizing the panel’s Republican majority. Democrats said that without Dodd-Frank the U.S. government would have had no tools to fight the widespread fraud, which led to the firing of 5,300 Wells employees. “I am particularly disturbed that this bill would take away the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s ability to penalize companies for practices that are abusive to consumers,” said New York’s Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat, echoing many in her party. “The chairman’s bill, strips...from the CFPB its authority to punish abusive conduct, which means Wells Fargo would have gotten off even easier.” Meanwhile, Randy Neugebauer, the Texas Republican who has advocated creating a five-member commission to govern the CFPB, said the bureau has not been politically neutral and is not transparent. “I remain concerned that many bureau actions demonstrate regulatory paternalism that assumes the American consumer doesn’t know how to make choices for themselves,” he said at the hearing. Corresponding legislation has not been introduced in the Senate, and Obama would be unlikely to sign the bill even both chambers of the Republican-led Congress passed it. Dodd-Frank is one of the Democratic president’s signature pieces of legislation. ",0

16973,"Hillary Clinton Struggles to Gain Traction in Florida, Despite Spending - The New York Times","TAMPA, Fla.  —   Hillary Clinton has vastly outspent Donald J. Trump on TV ads in Florida. Her 57 campaign offices dwarf Mr. Trump’s afterthought of a ground game. And Mr. Trump is deeply unpopular among Hispanics, who account for nearly one in five Florida voters. Despite these advantages, Mrs. Clinton is struggling in the Sunshine State, unable to assemble the coalition that gave Barack Obama two victories here, and offering Mr. Trump a broad opening in a road to the White House that not long ago seemed closed to him. Mr. Trump is pressing down hard to win the state, campaigning in Miami on Friday and in Fort Myers on Monday, after a rally in Pensacola recently. Recent polls show Mrs. Clinton is not earning the same support among Hispanics, young people or white voters that Mr. Obama captured when he eked out a Florida victory four years ago in the country’s most   swing state. Mrs. Clinton could afford to lose here and still find other routes to victory. Mr. Trump’s electoral map is narrower he must have Florida in his column. But as the most populous and one of the most racially diverse battleground states, Florida is also a bellwether for the nation: a candidate’s struggles here often are mirrored elsewhere. Polling in swing states that Mrs. Clinton once led, prompting predictions a month ago of an Election Day romp, now show Mr. Trump closing the gap or slightly ahead, including in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. “If she underperforms what Obama did in ’12, she’s not going to carry Florida,” said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic strategist in Miami. A poll his firm conducted for Univision, released last week, showed Mrs. Clinton winning 53 percent of Florida Hispanics, compared with the 60 percent who voted for Mr. Obama four years ago. After several weeks in which Mr. Trump attempted to sand off some of his rough edges and attacked Mrs. Clinton for portraying half his supporters as “deplorables,” the share of Florida voters who view the candidates unfavorably is now the same for Mr. Trump as for Mrs. Clinton, according to a   poll. In Miami on Friday, Mr. Trump said Mrs. Clinton’s bodyguards should disarm and “see what happens to her,” a comment that could renew voters’ doubts about his fitness for the presidency. The Clinton campaign maintains it always expected the Florida race to be tight. “Two months before the election, Hillary Clinton is within a couple of points of where President Obama ended on Election Day with Hispanic voters, while Donald Trump has been drastically underperforming Romney by 10 points or more,” John Anzalone, Mrs. Clinton’s pollster for Florida, said in a statement. With 20 million people and 10 major media markets, Florida is a place of vast diversity and contrasts that is a challenging puzzle for any statewide campaign. The traditional playbook has been for Democrats to run up the score in South Florida, with its large nonwhite population, and for Republicans to rack up votes in the conservative panhandle. That leaves Central Florida, and especially Tampa on the Gulf Coast, as one of the state’s most contested swing areas. The booming region has the largest share of registered voters statewide, with one in four voters in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, registered as independents. “The old saying is: ‘As goes Hillsborough County, so goes Florida,’ ” said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida in Tampa. Within this swing region, an epicenter of swing voters is the explosively growing New Tampa. It is a community of affordable subdivisions reached by grandiose landscaped entrances off a   highway, attracting young professionals with families. In interviews, undecided voters there seemed uncertain if they would cast ballots at all. Kish Nathan, 45, a computer professional born in India, voted for Mr. Obama four years ago. He has ruled out Mr. Trump, but is unenthusiastic about Mrs. Clinton. “I might not even vote,” he said. Leo Lewis, 51, was reading political news on a laptop outside a Starbucks. Mr. Trump scares him, Mr. Lewis said. Mrs. Clinton, he believes, is dissembling about her health. He, too, is considering sitting out the election. “The world has gotten so bad no matter what you do, no one’s going to fix it,” he said. Some strategists believe the pool of persuadable voters this year is shallower than in the past, which may explain why the tens of millions in TV ads run by Mrs. Clinton and her allies in the state have failed to give her a noticeable advantage. (Mr. Trump and outside supporters have spent about $8 million.) Representative Alcee L. Hastings, Democrat of Florida, said recently that the Clinton advertising push was a failure. “You give us $22 million, and I’ll produce more votes for you than a damn television ad,” Mr. Hastings told a meeting of Democrats, arguing that television does not reach young voters. Mrs. Clinton’s bulwark is her vast organizing effort, currently focused on registering new voters and signing up volunteers. But Republicans have not been idle: Field teams working for the Republican National Committee and state party have cut the Democrats’ advantage with registered voters in half since 2012. It is now just 258, 000 active voters. The Florida Democratic Party pointed out that of the 146, 000 newly registered Hispanic voters this year, only 15 percent are Republicans. “I want to make sure I give my vote to Hillary,” said Valesca Barilles, who registered for the first time with a Clinton volunteer outside a Dollar Tree store in Tampa last week. Born in Honduras, Ms. Barilles, an assistant bank branch manager, said of Mr. Trump, “I love the U. S. A. and I don’t think we need someone to come and ruin it. ” After poor   efforts during the primaries, Mr. Trump seems to be belatedly getting a ground game together. When he spoke in Pensacola, where the crowd was asked to text “Trump” to a number, some 3, 500 followed up on a reply message about how to check their voter registration, according to the campaign, and 1, 400 signed up to volunteer. “There is an army of R. N. C. volunteers and Trump volunteers crawling every part of this state every day,” said Susan Wiles, Mr. Trump’s state director. Mr. Trump must find a way to turn out a wave of white supporters who are infrequent voters. The campaign concedes that Mitt Romney’s field staff members four years ago drove conventional white turnout in Florida about as high as possible. In this state of   contests, every small demographic shift is closely watched. Mr. Obama won 37 percent of the state’s white vote in 2012. Mrs. Clinton is falling short of that number in    polls with Mr. Trump. “If she’s getting 34, 33, 35 among whites in Florida, I’m going to start to buy a lot of antacids,” said Steve Schale, who ran Mr. Obama’s Florida race in 2008 and was a senior adviser in 2012. Mrs. Clinton could make up for the erosion among whites by gaining with Hispanic voters. But so far, polls show Mrs. Clinton falling short of Mr. Obama’s 60 percent share of Florida Hispanics in 2012. “Against the candidate perceived to be the most hostile to Hispanic voters in modern presidential politics, why is she not exceeding where Barack Obama was?” Mr. Amandi, the Miami pollster, asked. He criticized the Clinton campaign for beginning   advertising only this month and for not doing a forum during the general election campaign with either Univision or Telemundo. “I think it’s too early to hit the panic button, but if these numbers by   aren’t at or slightly above where Obama was, there’s reason to be concerned,” he said. “She’s going to need all these votes to carry Florida. ” And Florida, he added, “is the whole enchilada. ”",0

21580, Trump Makes Total Ass Of Himself While Trying To Exploit Wounded Vet Receiving Purple Heart (VIDEO),"Donald Trump decided that he would exploit a wounded vet to make himself look good, but as usual, all he ended up doing was making a total ass out of himself. Again.Trump was visiting Walter Reed Medical Center on Saturday. So he decided it would be great publicity if he personally awarded the Purple Heart to Army Sgt. 1st Class Alvaro Barrientos. Things were going pretty well until Trump congratulated him on being wounded in Afghanistan.You see, while the Purple Heart is indeed one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon someone serving in the U.S. military, it also means that the recipient was either wounded or killed. As such, it isn t exactly the type of thing you  congratulate  somebody on.Barrientos was one of four soldiers who was wounded when an Afghan soldier attacked their base in the Helmland province last month. As a result of his injuries, Barrientos lost his right leg, which had to be amputated at the knee. You honor that but you sure as hell don t  congratulate  it.Trump, accompanied by Melania, presented Barrientos with the Purple Heart during a small ceremony at the hospital. I heard about this and I wanted to do it myself,  said Trump.  Congratulations on behalf of Melania, myself, and the entire nation. Tremendous job. He may not think words matter, but here in the real world, they most certainly do. Especially when you are the commander-in-chief awarding the Purple Heart to a service member who just had a leg amputated fighting your country s wars. Next time Trump decides to use a wounded vet a photo-op, he should be just a bit more careful when choosing his words.You can watch Trump congratulate a wounded soldier for having his leg amputated, here:Pres.

47628,"Todd Palin in intensive care after snowmobile accident, wife says","(Reuters) - Former U.S. vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin on Tuesday said her husband is still in the intensive care unit of an Alaska hospital with multiple injuries, including broken bones and a collapsed lung, two days after a serious snowmobile accident. Todd Palin, 51, suffered multiple broken ribs, a broken shoulder blade and clavicle, as well as knee and leg injuries. He was back in surgery to repair several fractures, Sarah Palin said in a statement on social media on Tuesday. “Knowing Todd, once he’s cognizant, he’ll probably ask docs to duct tape him up and he’ll call it good,” she said. “He’s tough.” An attorney for Sarah Palin declined to comment. A representative for the hospital where Todd Palin is said to be receiving treatment could not be reached. The accident on Sunday forced Sarah Palin to cut short a campaign trip for Donald Trump, the front-runner in the race for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination. Palin, who has endorsed Trump, had been scheduled to campaign for him on Monday in The Villages, a central Florida retirement community of more than 100,000 residents which has its own newspaper and radio station.  Florida is one of five states holding nominating contests on Tuesday for the Nov. 8 general election. Trump campaign officials said Palin, 52, was returning to Alaska to be with her husband and they looked forward to her return to the campaign trail soon. Sarah Palin was Republican Senator John McCain’s running mate in the 2008 presidential election won by Democrat Barack Obama. ",0
5362,Two Cases of Active TB ’Suspected’ in Houston Area High Schools,"Two “suspected” cases of active tuberculosis (TB) were reported in Houston area high schools in February. More than a month later, public health officials are not disclosing whether those “suspected” cases have been confirmed as active TB. [Parents at Clements High School in Sugar Land, Texas, a suburb of Houston, learned of “a suspected case of tuberculosis” on February 9. “Parents of students at El Campo High School were also informed of a student with a possible case of the illness,” KPRC Click2Houston. com reported in February.  School officials have not responded to requests for the current status of those two “suspected” cases of TB. Breitbart News has asked officials at both schools if the two individuals suspected of having TB were removed from school campuses and have remained away but has received no response. “This individual is undergoing treatment and is not contagious,” a spokesperson for the Fort Bend County Department of Health and Human Services tells Breitbart News about the individual who was “a suspected case of tuberculosis” at Clements High School in Sugar Land. “I’m not allowed to say what kind of treatment they are getting,” the spokesperson adds. “I cannot tell you what they were diagnosed with,” the spokesperson says when pressed further by Breitbart News. Public health and school officials were sufficiently concerned about the “suspected” cases of TB at both schools that they asked a number of students and staff members to be tested for the disease. School officials have not responded to requests for the current status of those two “suspected” cases of TB. Breitbart News has asked officials at both schools if the two individuals suspected of having TB were removed from school campuses and have remained away but has received no response. El Campo is a city of about 11, 000 in Wharton County, located forty miles southwest of Sugar Land. News of the two cases of TB at Houston area high schools comes on the heels of other recent disturbing reports of TB at high schools in Nebraska, Minnesota, and California, as well as a middle school in South Carolina. “We have met with the Texas Department of State Health Services pertaining to a suspected case of TB,” El Campo High School principal Rich DuBroc said in a statement posted on the school’s website on February 7: TB is a disease spread through prolonged, close exposure to someone who has the germ in   lungs. Exposure is most likely to occur when a person with TB is actively coughing. TB can usually be prevented and treated effectively with appropriate medications. As part of their ongoing investigation, DSHS will conduct a screening on Thursday, February 9, and Friday, February 10, for those individuals at El Campo High School who have been identified as having close exposure. Further information and consent forms will be shared tomorrow. “Fort Bend Clinical Health Services has notified Clements High School about a suspected case of tuberculosis (TB),” Clements High School principal David Yaffie wrote in a letter sent to parents on February 9: Tuberculosis is a bacterial illness acquired through breathing in infected droplets from the cough or sneeze of a person with active TB. Tuberculosis is not easily transmitted. It is spread when a person inhales airborne germs over a long period of time in a confined area from someone with the disease who coughs or sneezes. Confidentiality laws prohibit us from releasing the individual’s name. However, I can assure you the school is working actively with Fort Bend County Health  Human Services and taking all necessary steps in order to ensure the health and safety of all our students and staff. Because significant exposure to TB is required in order to develop an infection, and based on the level of interaction with the individual, the health department has identified a small group of students and staff who will require testing. They have received separate notification from the school and the health department. If you have not been contacted, there is no reason for your child to be tested at this time. However, if you would like, you may have your child tested by your private provider. “The results came back negative for the adults and students who were tested,” the spokesperson for the Fort Bend County Department of Health and Human Services tells Breitbart News about the results of these tests at Clements High School. Breitbart News posed the following questions about the case to Mr. Yaffie but has not received a response: 1. Has the Fort Bend Public Health Department advised whether this individual suspected of having TB was subsequently diagnosed with TB? 2. Was this individual a student, a teacher, or another staff member? 3. Was this individual an American citizen? 4. Was this individual a refugee or of other   immigrant status? 5. Was this individual removed from the school and are they still removed from the school? 6. How many students at Clements High are currently enrolled in English Language Learner programs? Clements High School is part of the Fort Bend Independent School District. El Campo High School is part of the much smaller El Campo Independent School District. Breitbart News contacted El Campo Independent School District Superintendent of Schools Mary Waters for comment but has not received a response. On February 22, El Campo High School principal Dubroc sent this   email: I am sending this to all   addresses in the ECHS system, but it applies only to those who tested for Tuberculosis with us at ECHS. Earlier this month DSHS conducted Round 1 Tuberculosis testing due to a suspect case at El Campo High School. To ensure notification of results is sent to the correct address, please complete the attached address authorization consent form.   …     A   test  —   Round 2 Tuberculosis testing  —   will be offered the week of April 10, 2017. A negative   test at that time would indicate that your child has not been infected with the germ that causes Tuberculosis. Clements High School, as part of the Fort Bend Independent School District, offers “ESL (English as a Second Language) for parents” free of charge. “FBISD’s family literacy program helps families build the foundation for life long learning,” according to the Fort Bend Independent School District website: The comprehensive program includes: ESL (English as a Second Language) for parentsHomework assistance, tutoring, or early childhood education, while parents attend classParent education classes: GED, citizenship, computer   activities for parents and childrenLatino Family Literacy ProjectAll services are FREE! As Breitbart News has reported extensively, 66 percent of all cases of active TB diagnosed in the United States in 2015 were  .",0
20680," Mueller Just Told Trump To F*ck Off With His Threats, Expands Probe To Trump Family Finances","On Wednesday, Donald Trump warned the special counsel investigating the Russia scandal not to look into his business or personal finances and that s exactly like saying,  Hey, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, look into my finances!  Well, that s just what happened. It s like after robbing a bank and the police stop you for running a red light, so you say,  Don t look in the trunk! So, as part of the probe into possible ties between the Donald Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 presidential election, the Special Counsel is now is examining a broad range of transactions involving Trump s businesses as well as those of his associates, according to what a person familiar with the probe told Bloomberg.FBI investigators and others are looking at Russian purchases of apartments in Trump buildings, Trump s involvement in a controversial SoHo development in New York with Russian associates, the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and Trump s sale of a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008, the person said.The Trump Crime Family and Associates look like they re in deep sh*t:The investigation also has absorbed a money-laundering probe begun by federal prosecutors in New York into Trump s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Trump s lawyer, John Dowd, said on Thursday that the inquiry into Trump s businesses is  unrelated  to last year s election. Those transactions are in my view well beyond the mandate of the Special counsel; are unrelated to the election of 2016 or any alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and most importantly, are well beyond any Statute of Limitation imposed by the United States Code,  he stated in an email.We disagree! There s a saying which goes like this:  Follow the money  and apparently, Mueller has heard that wise quote before. There s a way that Trump could clear this all up. It would require the sitting  president  to release his tax returns, you know, like all of his predecessors have done.By the way, if Trump s resort in Florida mysteriously catches fire and he says,  Don t look in the garage for propellant  then I m pretty sure they will look into the garage. Nevertheless, Trump didn t see this coming. Somehow.Photo by Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images",1
7371,'There are many instances’ of voter fraud: GOP VP candidate Pence,"Politics US Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence speaks at a rally on October 25, 2016 in Marietta, Ohio. (Photo by AFP) 
US Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence says the mainstream media is biased against Donald Trump, and there are “many instances” of voter fraud in the run up to the November 8 election. 
Republican presidential nominee Trump has recently intensified his criticism of the American electoral system. He calls the election process rigged, and says the media is colluding with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in order to win the White House. 
He has questioned the legitimacy of the US elections, saying that he believed the vote was already being ""rigged"" at many polling places. 
During his final presidential debate with Clinton last week, Trump declared that he might not accept the results of the November 8 presidential election if there is evidence it was rigged. 
In an interview with CBS News on Friday, Trump’s running mate, Pence, said, “Make no mistake about it, there are many instances in our lifetimes of voter fraud in individual polling places and in certain jurisdictions.” 
“Donald Trump and I are just calling on people to respectfully participate in the electoral process. We want a victory on Election Day, but we also want it to be a victory for American democracy,” he stated. Donald Trump speaks at an event on October 15, 2016 in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. (Photo by AFP) 
The governor of Indiana rejected claims of critics that Trump’s “rigging” rhetoric may encourage violence by his supporters if he loses the presidential election. 
“We certainly would denounce any calls for anything other people being vigorously involved in the electoral process,” he said. 
“I have to tell you, I really don’t see it. The people that rallying around our team, rallying around our cause, love this country, are passionate about this country and are anxious to see change,” the GOP vice presidential nominee stated. 
He went on to accuse the media of unfairly backing Clinton. 
“The level of negative coverage about my running mate in many quarters in the national media has just been overwhelming compared to any negative coverage or frankly the avalanche of scandals coming out of Hillary Clinton’s years as secretary of State,” Pence said.

According to a recent poll released, 41 percent of American voters are saying the 2016 election could be ""stolen"" from Trump due to widespread voter fraud. 
And 73 percent of Republican voters think the election could be stolen from the billionaire businessman, while 17 percent of Democrats agree with the prospect of rigging. 
American writer and political commentator Stephen Lendman told Press TV on October 17 Washington has been rigging elections for nearly 200 years in order to keep anti-establishment candidates away from the White House. Loading ...",1
36733,The Existential Question Of Whom To Trust,"21st Century Wire says Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980 s and has been a featured guest on Patrick Henningsen LIVE at 1100KFNX.  In this report, Robert asks due to mainstream media experts who ve fallen to  careerism , whom can we trust to deliver us the information to describe the world and its conflicts. (Image   Former Secretary of State, Colin Powell addressing the United Nations on Feb. 5. 2003)Robert Parry Consortium NewsThe looming threat of World War III, a potential extermination event for the human species, is made more likely because the world s public can t count on supposedly objective experts to ascertain and evaluate facts. Instead, careerism is the order of the day among journalists, intelligence analysts and international monitors   meaning that almost no one who might normally be relied on to tell the truth can be trustedThe dangerous reality is that this careerism, which often is expressed by a smug certainty about whatever the prevailing groupthink is, pervades not just the political world, where lies seem to be the common currency, but also the worlds of journalism, intelligence and international oversight, including United Nations agencies that are often granted greater credibility because they are perceived as less beholden to specific governments but in reality have become deeply corrupted, too.In other words, many professionals who are counted on for digging out the facts and speaking truth to power have sold themselves to those same powerful interests in order to keep high-paying jobs and to not get tossed out onto the street. Many of these self-aggrandizing professionals   caught up in the many accouterments of success   don t even seem to recognize how far they ve drifted from principled professionalism.A good example was Saturday night s spectacle of national journalists preening in their tuxedos and gowns at the White House Correspondents Dinner, sporting First Amendment pins as if they were some brave victims of persecution. They seemed oblivious to how removed they are from Middle America and how unlikely any of them would risk their careers by challenging one of the Establishment s favored groupthinks. Instead, these national journalists take easy shots at President Trump s buffoonish behavior and his serial falsehoods   and count themselves as endangered heroes for the effort.FOILS FOR TRUMPIronically, though, these pompous journalists gave Trump what was arguably his best moment in his first 100 days by serving as foils for the President as he traveled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday and basked in the adulation of blue-collar Americans who view the mainstream media as just one more appendage of a corrupt ruling elite.Breaking with tradition by snubbing the annual press gala, Trump delighted the Harrisburg crowd by saying:  A large group of Hollywood celebrities and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom  and adding:  I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be more than 100 miles away from [the] Washington swamp   with much, much better people.  The crowd booed references to the elites and cheered Trump s choice to be with the common folk.Trump s rejection of the dinner and his frequent criticism of the mainstream media brought a defensive response from Jeff Mason, president of the White House Correspondents  Association, who complained:  We are not fake news. We are not failing news organizations. And we are not the enemy of the American people.  That brought the black-tie-and-gown gathering to its feet in a standing ovation.Perhaps the assembled media elite had forgotten that it was the mainstream U.S. media   particularly The Washington Post and The New York Times   that popularized the phrase  fake news  and directed it blunderbuss-style not only at the few Web sites that intentionally invent stories to increase their clicks but at independent-minded journalism outlets that have dared question the elite s groupthinks on issues of war, peace and globalization.THE BLACK LISTProfessional journalistic skepticism toward official claims by the U.S. government   what you should expect from reporters   became conflated with  fake news.  The Post even gave front-page attention to an anonymous group called PropOrNot that published a black list of 200 Internet sites, including Consortiumnews.com and other independent-minded journalism sites, to be shunned.But the mainstream media stars didn t like it when Trump began throwing the  fake news  slur back at them. Thus, the First Amendment lapel pins and the standing ovation for Jeff Mason s repudiation of the  fake news  label.Yet, as the glitzy White House Correspondents Dinner demonstrated, mainstream journalists get the goodies of prestige and money while the real truth-tellers are almost always outspent, outgunned and cast out of the mainstream. Indeed, this dwindling band of honest people who are both knowledgeable and in position to expose unpleasant truths is often under mainstream attack, sometimes for unrelated personal failings and other times just for rubbing the powers-that-be the wrong way.Perhaps, the clearest case study of this up-is-down rewards-and-punishments reality was the Iraq War s WMD rationale. Nearly across the board, the American political/media system   from U.S. intelligence analysts to the deliberative body of the U.S. Senate to the major U.S. news organizations   failed to ascertain the truth and indeed actively helped disseminate the falsehoods about Iraq hiding WMDs and even suggested nuclear weapons development. (Arguably, the  most trusted  U.S. government official at the time, Secretary of State Colin Powell, played a key role in selling the false allegations as  truth. )Not only did the supposed American  gold standard  for assessing information   the U.S. political, media and intelligence structure   fail miserably in the face of fraudulent claims often from self-interested Iraqi opposition figures and their neoconservative American backers, but there was minimal accountability afterwards for the  professionals  who failed to protect the public from lies and deceptions.PROFITING FROM FAILUREIndeed, many of the main culprits remain  respected  members of the journalistic establishment. For instance, The New York Times  Pentagon correspondent Michael R. Gordon, who was the lead writer on the infamous  aluminum tubes for nuclear centrifuges  story which got the ball rolling for the Bush administration s rollout of its invade-Iraq advertising campaign in September 2002, still covers national security for the Times   and still serves as a conveyor belt for U.S. government propaganda.The Washington Post s editorial page editor Fred Hiatt, who repeatedly informed the Post s readers that Iraq s secret possession of WMD was a  flat-fact,  is still the Post s editorial page editor, one of the most influential positions in American journalism.Hiatt s editorial page led a years-long assault on the character of former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson for the offense of debunking one of President George W. Bush s claims about Iraq seeking yellowcake uranium from Niger. Wilson had alerted the CIA to the bogus claim before the invasion of Iraq and went public with the news afterwards, but the Post treated Wilson as the real culprit, dismissing him as  a blowhard  and trivializing the Bush administration s destruction of his wife s CIA career by outing her (Valerie Plame) in order to discredit Wilson s Niger investigation.At the end of the Post s savaging of Wilson s reputation and in the wake of the newspaper s accessory role in destroying Plame s career, Wilson and Plame decamped from Washington to New Mexico. Meanwhile, Hiatt never suffered a whit   and remains a  respected  Washington media figure to this day.CAREERIST LESSONThe lesson that any careerist would draw from the Iraq case is that there is almost no downside risk in running with the pack on a national security issue. Even if you re horrifically wrong   even if you contribute to the deaths of some 4,500 U.S. soldiers and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis   your paycheck is almost surely safe.The same holds true if you work for an international agency that is responsible for monitoring issues like chemical weapons. Again, the Iraq example offers a good case study. In April 2002, as President Bush was clearing away the few obstacles to his Iraq invasion plans, Jose Mauricio Bustani, the head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], sought to persuade Iraq to join the Chemical Weapons Convention so inspectors could verify Iraq s claims that it had destroyed its stockpiles.The Bush administration called that idea an  ill-considered initiative    after all, it could have stripped away the preferred propaganda rationale for the invasion if the OPCW verified that Iraq had destroyed its chemical weapons. So, Bush s Undersecretary of State for Arms Control John Bolton, a neocon advocate for the invasion of Iraq, pushed to have Bustani deposed. The Bush administration threatened to withhold dues to the OPCW if Bustani, a Brazilian diplomat, remained.It now appears obvious that Bush and Bolton viewed Bustani s real offense as interfering with their invasion scheme, but Bustani was ultimately taken down over accusations of mismanagement, although he was only a year into a new five-year term after having been reelected unanimously. The OPCW member states chose to sacrifice Bustani to save the organization from the loss of U.S. funds, but   in so doing   they compromised its integrity, making it just another agency that would bend to big-power pressure. By dismissing me,  Bustani said,  an international precedent will have been established whereby any duly elected head of any international organization would at any point during his or her tenure remain vulnerable to the whims of one or a few major contributors.  He added that if the United States succeeded in removing him,  genuine multilateralism  would succumb to  unilateralism in a multilateral disguise Continue this report at Consortium News READ MORE US NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire US FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",1

If you have children, have them avert their eyes so they aren’t forever scarred by the images of Clinton that decorate this person’s yard. 
This house in Bellmore!!! 
Posted by Brian Mc Kibbin on Thursday, October 20, 2016 
The video of the house, posted on Facebook by Brian McKibbin, has gone viral, garnering over 2.5 million views in less than a week. Advertisement - story continues below 
The house was decorated with signs calling Clinton a “traitor,”“liar” and “murderer.” The house also featured several large displays encouraging people to vote for Republican nominee Donald Trump. 
It was unclear whether the person behind the decorations decided to do this for Halloween or just because he really doesn’t like Clinton . In any case, it really is an awesome display that works perfectly for both Halloween and the upcoming election. 
While this house might be scary, the real nightmare would be Clinton actually being elected. That’s why you need to get out and vote. If your state has early voting, go vote right away. 
We can laugh about this house’s anti-Hillary display all we want, but if she wins on Nov. 8, we won’t be laughing anymore. Advertisement - story continues below",1
48242,Obama visits a mosque to send pointed message to non-Muslims,"CATONSVILLE, Md. (Reuters) - President Barack Obama made his first visit to a U.S. mosque on Wednesday, in an effort to allay the fears of Americans accustomed to pop-culture portrayals of Muslims as terrorists, and to reassure Muslim American youth about their place in the nation. Obama, declaring that attacks on Islam were an attack on all religions, decried the “inexcusable political rhetoric” against Muslims from Donald Trump and other Republican presidential candidates. “We have to understand that an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths,” he said at the mosque outside of Baltimore, which he said had received threats twice in the past year. “When any religious group is targeted, we all have a responsibility to speak up.” Trump, the Republican front-runner, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States after authorities described a California couple who killed 14 people last December as radicalized Muslims inspired by Islamic State militants. Obama’s visit was aimed at showing Americans another side of Islam. Before he spoke, Cub Scouts who attend a school run by the mosque carried the American and Maryland state flags into the prayer hall, a plain room save for a three rows of window panes, 99 in all, each depicting one of the names of Allah in Arabic. “Think of your own church or synagogue or temple, and a mosque like this will be very familiar,” said Obama, who, following Islamic custom, took off his shoes to enter the hall. The children led the audience, with some men in prayer caps and most women in head scarves, in the Pledge of Allegiance. A man and a woman recited a verse from the Koran about tolerance and inclusion. Obama, a Christian, outlined the tenets of Islam, and gave a brief history of Muslims in America. He noted that founding father Thomas Jefferson specifically mentioned Muslims when he spoke about the American right to freedom of religion. “Thomas Jefferson’s opponents tried to stir things up by suggesting he was a Muslim, so I was not the first,” said Obama, who has long been accused of secretly being a Muslim, to a roar of laugher. “I’m in good company,” he said. Obama asked a row of Muslim American military service members to stand, as well as Ibtihaj Muhammad, a member of the U.S. fencing team who will be the first American Olympian to compete in a hijab, or head scarf, in this year’s Rio Olympics. The president touched on pop-culture depictions of Muslims as terrorists. “Our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security, Obama said. Turning to extremist groups such as Islamic State and what he characterized as perverted versions of Islam portrayed by them, Obama urged regular Muslims to “show who you are. To use a little Christian expression - let your light shine.” Later, he told a crowd of cheering children, who had packed the mosque’s gymnasium to watch his speech on large screens, that one day they too could become president. Obama urged young Muslims not to embrace a worldview that required them to choose between faith and patriotism. “You fit in here. Right here,” he said. “You’re not Muslim or American. You’re Muslim and American.” ",0
25434," House GOP Holds Zika Bill Hostage, Proposes Plan To Slash Birth Control Funding","Pregnant women throughout the America s are threatened by the Zika virus, but House Republicans couldn t care less and are still holding the bill that would fight the epidemic hostage. The GOP released their latest funding proposal on Wednesday and the plan proposes cuts to the federal grant that helps low-income women access birth control and other family planning services.The Title X Family Planning program, which was established more than 45 years ago, provides reproductive healthcare services to 4.1 million patients each year, preventing approximately 1 million unplanned pregnancies. So naturally, conservatives are hell bent on eliminating Title X.The Huffington Post reports:  The House Appropriations Committee proposed cutting the program in its draft Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies funding bill for fiscal year 2017. This is the fifth time Republicans have attempted to scrap Title X. Under the GOP proposal, $108 million would be cut from programs that focus on preventing teen pregnancies.The funding bill does allocate $390 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to fight the Zika virus, but women s health advocates warn that the middle of a Zika outbreak is not the time to cut funding for contraception. Zika can be transmitted both through mosquitos and sexually. Women who become infected with the virus while pregnant can have babies born with severe birth defects, including microcephaly. Babies born with microcephaly have malformed brains and abnormally small heads, and they face a lifetime of challenges.Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, said that cutting funding smack dab in the middle of the Zika outbreak would be  particularly foolish. It is particularly foolish to target Title X at a time when the nation is at the precipice of a public health emergency resulting from the Zika virus. For the House to propose defunding the very provider network that is being called upon to address and control the risk to women who may be seeking to prevent pregnancy is absurd.Republicans in Congress have such a dislike for Title X because some of its funding goes to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions among its range of services. None of that money pays for abortions, however, and federal law already prevents these grants from being used to fund abortions.According to a statement released by House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), the goal of the funding bill is to reduc[e] discretionary spending by more than half a billion dollars, all the while prioritizing funding where it is needed the most. It follows the responsible lead of the legislation before it   investing in proven, effective programs, rolling back over regulation and overreach by the Administration that kills American jobs, and cutting spending to save hard earned taxpayer dollars.Last month, the House passed a funding proposal for Zika that also limits access to contraception. This completely ignores the request by the CDC for money to distribute birth control and condoms in areas stricken by Zika.Dana Singiser, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood, called the bill  shameful. Politicians who want to eliminate these vital services are working against a solution, and are part of the problem. Today s budget bill is shameful and exposes the Republican leadership s targeted agenda against family planning providers like Planned Parenthood, despite their absolutely critical role in limiting the damaging effects of Zika virus and continuing to provide access to reproductive health services for those most in need.Since last year, 24 states have tried to defund Planned Parenthood. Many of the states that are expected to be hardest hit by Zika as temperatures rise and mosquitos flourish are also states where  lawmakers have slashed family planning services, chipped away at safe and legal abortion and declined to expand Medicaid coverage.

23098, WATCH: Racist Trump Supporter Who Called Michelle Obama A ‘Gorilla’ Gets Booted Off School Board,"The Buffalo School Board refuses to tolerate racism from one of their own members, and decisively voted to oust a racist Trump supporter from their ranks on Thursday.Earlier this month, Carl Paladino wrote a wish list hoping for President Obama s death from mad cow disease and called for First Lady Michelle Obama to be sent to live with gorillas in Africa. I d like her to return to being a male and let loose in the outback of Zimbabwe where she lives comfortably in a cave with Maxie, the gorilla,  Paladino wrote.Predictably, national outrage ensued as Paladino s own son condemned him. We value and respect our employees, friends, partners and all of our commercial and residential tenancies and we do not condone the statements made about the President of the United States and his wife,  William Paladino wrote.  They were disrespectful and absolutely unnecessary. And just this week, Paladino issued a pathetic non-apology apology while calling President Obama lazy and blaming the media for the outrage over his racist remarks before declaring,  No, I m not leaving the school board. Oh, yes he is, if the school board has anything to say about it.On Thursday, the board voted 6-2 on a resolution condemning Paladino s remarks and demanding his resignation.School Board President Barbara Seals Nevergold had strong words for Paladino, who didn t bother attending the meeting because he s a coward. Words matter, Mr. Paladino,  Nevergold said.  The impact on children of color, especially African-American children is incalculable   They would like me to tell you,  You re fired. The resolution blasted Paladino for his  unambiguously racist, morally repugnant, flagrantly disrespectful, inflammatory and inexcusable comments,  and explained that his remarks  garnered both local, national, and international attention that reflects negatively on the Buffalo Board of Education, the City of Buffalo and its leadership and its citizens. In addition, if Paladino refuses to resign the Buffalo School Board is going to get an attorney to file an application of removal to the State Education Department to force him out.In short, Paladino can resist but the school board has spoken and so did the many people in attendance who cheered when the resolution passed.Here s video of the meeting via Twitter.#BREAKING resolution calling for @CarlPaladino to resign from the @Buffalo_Schools BOE in 24 hours passes 6-2 @WGRZ pic.twitter.com/8T6an1ukCG  Jeff Preval (@PrevalWGRZ) December 29, 2016And Carl Paladino has only himself to blame.Featured image via screenshot",1
6535,The Zika Virus Is Harmless. It Does Not Cause Birth Defects (Bill Gates Releasing GM Mosquitoes Anyway),"After nearly a year of causing hysteria, mass travel cancellations and unnecessary abortions it finally daunts to “journalists” and “experts” that the Zika virus is harmless. It can cause a very minor flue – two days of a low fever and uncomfortable feeling for a quarter of those infected – that is all. It does not cause, as was claimed by sensationalists in the media and various self-serving “scientists”, birth defects like microcephaly. 
We told you so. 
In February we wrote: The Zika Virus Is Harmless – Who Then Benefits From This Media Panic? .
The piece refereed to a Congressional Research Service report and various sound scientific papers. It concluded:
There is absolutely no sane reason for the scary headlines and the panic they cause.The virus is harmless. It is possible, but seems for now very unlikely, that it affects some unborn children. There is absolutely no reason to be concerned about it.
The artificial media panic continued and huge amounts of money were poured into dangerous insecticides to kill mosquitoes (and important pollinators) that did not do any harm. Indeed, generous use of some of these insecticides likely were the very cause of a blip in microencephaly cases in northeastern Brazil.

In March we wrote: Reading About Zika May Hurt Your Brain .
We listed 35 sensational “news” headlines about potential catastrophes related to a Zika epidemic. The common factor of those panic creating media wave – all those headlines included the miraculous little word may . The pieces were pure speculations with some quoting this or that “expert” who was hunting for research funds or lobbying for some pharmaceutical or pesticide conglomerate.
In June we added: Zika Virus Does Not Cause Birth Defects – Fighting It Probably Does .
New serious research found what some people in Brazil had suspected from the very start of the small and strictly locally limited jump in microencephaly cases in Brazil:
[D]octors in the Zika affected areas in Brazil pointed out that the real cause of somewhat increased microcephaly in the region was probably the insecticide pyriproxyfen, used to kill mosquito larvae in drinking water:
The Brazilian doctors noted that the areas of northeast Brazil that had witnessed the greatest number of microcephaly cases match with areas where pyriproxyfen is added to drinking water in an effort to combat Zika-carrying mosquitoes . Pyriproxyfen is reported to cause malformations in mosquito larvae, and has been added to drinking water in the region for the past 18 months.
Pyriproxyfen is produced by a Sumitomo Chemical – an important Japanese poison giant. It was therefore unsurprising that the New York Times and others called the Brazilian doctors’ report a “conspiracy theory” and trotted out some “experts” to debunk it.
…
But [s]cientist at the New England Complex Systems Institute also researched the pyriproxyfen thesis. They found :
Pyriproxifen is an analog of juvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly .
…
[T]ests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as giving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for such an effect , including low brain mass and arhinencephaly—incomplete formation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres—in rat pups. Finally, the pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented—it has never before been applied to a water supply on such a scale.
…
Given this combination of information we strongly recommend that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended pending further investigation.
Today the Washington Post finally admits that the Zika virus does not cause birth defects:
[T]o the great bewilderment of scientists, the epidemic has not produced the wave of fetal deformities so widely feared when the images of misshapen infants first emerged from Brazil.Instead, Zika has left a puzzling and distinctly uneven pattern of damage across the Americas. According to the latest U.N. figures, of the 2,175 babies born in the past year with undersize heads or other congenital neurological damage linked to Zika, more than 75 percent have been clustered in a single region: northeastern Brazil.
The wide areas where the flue virus occurred outside of the small area in Brazil saw no increase in birth defect numbers. The number of (naturally occurring) microcephality cases stayed constant despite a very large increase in (harmless) Zika virus infections. The numbers in Brazil also turned out to be partially inflated because of a lack of standard diagnosis criteria and unreliable statistics. A factor we had pointed to in our very first piece.
The WaPo piece today muses about several “possible” causes for the local increase in cases in northeastern Brazil that indeed happened. It quotes some of the very “experts”, like from the pharmaceutical industry influenced CDC, that were wrong on the issue since the very first panic headline. It strenuously avoids to even mention the most likely cause – the excessive local use of an insecticide that is supposed to cause birth defects – in developing mosquitoes. Thus the reporting is still void of journalistic ethics and irresponsible in its conclusions.
It did not take much effort to get this right. An hour or two of skimming through publicly available sources of good standing, some basic higher education and sound reasoning was enough. But instead of doing such basic inquiries “journalists” and media “served” panic and speculations by biased “experts”. Keep this story in mind for the next sensationalist onslaught of panic headline. There surely will be some “interests” behind those; just don’t expect unbiased facts and basic logic reasoning.

Yet, Millions of GMO Mosquitoes set to be released in Brazil & Columbia… Scientists are planning to release an army of millions of modified mosquitoes in areas of Brazil and Colombia.
They say the unusual approach is an attempt to provide “revolutionary protection” against mosquito-borne diseases such as Zika and chikungunya.
The mosquitoes are infected with a bug called Wolbachia which reduces their ability to spread viruses to people.
The $18m dollar project is funded by an international team of donors, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation…

23902, Libertarian Candidate Gary Johnson STUNS America With Statement On Presidential Election,"For months, various third parties have been making all sorts of noises about how we need third-party candidates in the presidential elections if we ever want to break the tyranny of the two-party system. This has resonated especially well with people who think Hillary Clinton is about as bad as Donald Trump. However, Libertarian Gary Johnson, and his running mate, Bill Weld, have issued a surprising announcement about this election that doesn t include begging for votes for Johnson.The Johnson-Weld campaign believes that Trump is a monumentally bad choice for President of the United States, saying, in their statement on the matter: A President of the United States operates every day under a great deal of pressure   from all sides, and in furtherance of many different agendas. With that pressure comes constant criticism.After careful observation and reflection, I have come to believe that Donald Trump, if elected President of the United States, would not be able to stand up to this pressure and this criticism without becoming unhinged and unable to perform competently the duties of his office.  [emphasis mine]No, Trump wouldn t be able to handle the pressure. Johnson and Weld are both reading this quite correctly, because Trump is a) too thin-skinned to deal with hostile world leaders who might ridicule him (along with a hostile Congress that just won t do his bidding), and b) just plain too mired in fascism to be the leader of the free world. He would destroy the free world.The campaign went on to say: Mr. Trump has some charisma and panache, and intellectual quickness. These qualities can be entertaining. Yet more than charisma, more even than intellectual ability, is required of a serious candidate for this country s highest office. A serious candidate for the Presidency of the United States must be stable, and Donald Trump is not stable.  [emphasis mine]While it does sound like they re admitting defeat and endorsing Hillary, or, at least, trying to convince people to vote for Hillary, that s not quite the case, whatever other sites have claimed. The Johnson-Weld campaign wants the Nov. 8 election to be between Johnson and Hillary, rather than Hillary and Trump: Governor Weld and Governor Johnson are campaigning nonstop, with rallies and appearances scheduled over the next few days across the country from Alaska to Cincinnati, and are fully committed to giving voters the third choice they deserve in this election.Any suggestion to the contrary is the product of active imaginations and partisans in both the Republican and Democrat camps who see how many independents, millennials [sic] and other disenfranchised voters are looking to the Johnson-Weld ticket as a vote they can cast in good conscience. Either way, the Johnson campaign, despite being much closer to Republicans than Democrats ideologically, cannot stomach voting for Trump. They can t tolerate their voters voting for Trump, either, but neither do they want their voters choosing Hillary.Featured image by Bill McCay via Getty Images for SiriusXM",1
47629,U.S. hopes easing limits on Cuba will boost reform in Havana: officials,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States hopes a new package of U.S. regulatory changes affecting Cuba will encourage people-to-people interactions and provide additional incentives for Havana to make economic and trade reforms of its own, U.S. officials said on Tuesday. The regulatory reforms, which were introduced earlier on Tuesday, loosen travel restrictions on Cuba and ease limits on the use of U.S. dollars in trade transactions there just days ahead of President Barack Obama’s historic visit to the former Cold War enemy. U.S. officials told reporters the new rules would allow more Cubans to work legally in the United States without having to defect, but they declined to predict how that might affect Major League Baseball. “It certainly does address the ability of Cuban athletes who can earn salaries in the United States to do so,” one official told reporters in a briefing.

55825,Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric Sistani opposes secession of Kurdish region,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq s top Shi ite cleric opposes the secession of the Kurdistan region in northern Iraq, his representative said in a Friday sermon on his behalf, in the religious leader s first comments on the Kurds  decision to back independence in a referendum. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, a reclusive octogenarian, is revered by millions of Shi ite Muslims in Iraq and abroad. Sistani believes that  any attempt to make secession an accomplished fact will lead to undesired consequences affecting Kurdish citizens , his representative Ahmed al-Safi said in the sermon in the holy Shi ite city of Kerbala, south of Baghdad. He urged the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)  to return to the constitutional path in solving disputes  such as self-determination for the Kurdish people, Safi said. It is the first direct political sermon by Sistani since early 2016, in a clear sign that he attaches importance to the crisis pitting the KRG against Baghdad and Iraq s neighbors. Sistani stopped making direct political comments in Feb. 2016, in protest at the widespread and deep-rooted corruption within Iraqi government institutions. Most Iraqi Kurds are Sunni Muslims but Kurdish northern Iraq is also home to some Shi ite Turkmens and Arabs. The Shi ite-led government in Baghdad is set to impose a ban on international flights to and from Iraq s Kurdistan region from 6 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Friday, in retaliation for the vote. Masoud Barzani s KRG says Monday s referendum, which delivered an overwhelming yes for independence, was meant to pave the way for a peaceful secession from Iraq, through talks with Baghdad and neighboring states Turkey and Iran.  Barzani said last week one reason for holding the referendum was because he feared Iraq, split between a Shi ite majority and Sunni minority, was becoming a sectarian-based  theocracy , not a proper democracy as promised after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that ousted veteran ruler Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi government has rejected any talks with the KRG and demanded that the Kurdish leadership cancel the result in order to avoid sanctions, international isolation and possibly a military intervention.

6461,Vladimir Putin: The United States continues to sleep with al-Nusra,"By Jonas E. Alexis on October 27, 2016 Putin: “Some people, from the outside, think that if they can ‘comb’ the region to how they see fit – some of them call this ‘democracy’ – then the region will come into calmness and order. That’s not how it is."" “Will NWO agents ever learn logic?” …by Jonas E. Alexis 
The United States and New World Order agents have obviously enough reasons to hate Vladimir Putin because he doesn’t back down when it comes to fighting terrorism and the New World Order in Syria. Putin delivers. And obviously NWO agents would love to see his head on a silver platter. Putin declares: 
“ You know what [the Americans] can’t answer us? The key armed opposition group…al-Nusra…Yes, this organization is one of the key ones in the armed opposition [against Assad]. The U.S. State Department has confirmed it is a terrorist organization linked to al-Qaeda. Al-Nusra does not hide that fact. And – what are [the Americans suggesting]? For al-Nusra to be in the future parliament? 
“Or, here’s another example. They support certain organizations that are fighting against Assad in Syria, yet those same countries [who support them in Syria] fight against these organizations in Mali. Often, not only are they the same organizations – they are the same individuals. They simply leave Syria and go to fight in Mali – where western states do not support them. Then the same people go back to Syria and there they are supported.” 
Read those statements again and ask yourself these questions: When was the last time that a leader in Europe and in America ever pointed them out? Has even John Kerry ever taken time to responsibly address this internal contradiction? Has any NWO agent ever even bothered to give their listeners a rational response? 
Well, not a single NWO agent has ever attempted to formulate a serious answer. Not one. In fact, what we have been hearing over and over is that Russia is the bad guy; Putin is a potentate seeking to expand Russia’s influence in the entire world; Russia is not attacking ISIS or terrorist groups but civilians in Syria, and on and on it goes. 
Putin asks: “Where is the logic? How will it all end? These are not just empty words.” 
Well, Mr. Putin, there is no logic at all. The New World Order does not have to have logic and formulate serious arguments. They have to resort to name calling, colossal hoaxes, complete and deliberate fabrications, and deceptive means. These issues have been certainly frustrating to Russian officials, including Russia’s Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Maria Zakharova. YouTube - Veterans Today - 
Christopher A. Preble wrote in The New Republic that Assad posed no threat whatsoever to the security of the United States, that it was foolish for the US to get involved in this war, and that 81 percent of the American people did not approve sending troops to Syria. [1] 
Russia in particular wanted to talk to the Syrian rebels in order to settle a peace treaty, but their response was that the toppling of Assad was a precondition for peace talk. [2] Who, then, are the real terrorists? 
No New World Order agent will answer this question in any rational fashion because the system itself is incoherent and worthless. Putin again nails it when he says: “Some people, from the outside, think that if they can ‘comb’ the region to how they see fit – some of them call this ‘democracy’ – then the region will come into calmness and order. That’s not how it is. Without taking into account the history, the traditions, religious particularities, you must not do anything in the Middle East, especially as an outsider.” 
Obviously New World Order agents, most specifically the Neocons, are still upset with Putin. They still blame him for virtually anything bad that happens in Syria. Flaming Neocon Max Boot has recently written: 
“Russia aircraft dropped incendiaries, cluster munitions, and even giant ‘bunker buster’ bombs on homes and hospitals, killing and maiming at random.” [3] 
Boot talks about “a durable peace” in Syria, but for that to happen, he advocates a serious confrontation with Assad, which would inexorably lead to another confrontation with Russia. 
In a similar vein, Matthew Kroenig of the Weekly Standard cannot sleep well at night because he thinks that “Putin’s nuclear trash talk needs a serious response.” [4] 
If Putin is the real threat here, then Kroenig has a lot of rethinking to do precisely because the state of Israel doesn’t just declare that they have nuclear warheads. They literally declare that they can obliterate cities in Europe practically overnight. Remember Martin van Creveld’s bold statement? Here it is again: “We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions, perhaps even at Rome. Most European capitals are targets for our air force…. We have the capability to take the world down with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under.” [5] 
Keep in mind that Creveld is an Israeli military historian. He has written books for Cambridge University Press and other academic institutions. Yet Zionist outlets were completely silent about his statement. In fact, they never seriously challenged him or even the state of Israel on that very issue. 
Those outlets are much more interested in Vladimir Putin and Assad than addressing the serious issues. That is one reason why organs like the Economist , Newsweek , and the New Statesman never missed an opportunity to attack Putin. 
Yet despite all their lies and fabrications, Russia continues to thrive. Perhaps NWO agents need to learn very quickly that truth will triumph in the end.

41446,"Trump, Republicans face tricky task of averting U.S. government shutdown","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress face their first major budget test next week, with the threat of a U.S. government shutdown potentially hinging on his proposed Mexican border wall as well as Obamacare funding. With Republicans controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress, keeping the federal government operating is a basic test of their ability to govern, but their task could become even more complicated if they insist on using the spending legislation to bring about contentious policy changes. Not only must Republicans overcome intraparty ideological divisions that stopped major healthcare legislation last month, but they will have to win over some opposition Democrats with provisions that could be distasteful to conservatives. With the Senate reconvening on Monday and the House of Representatives on Tuesday after a two-week recess, lawmakers will have only four days to pass a spending package to keep the government open beyond April 28, when funding expires for numerous federal programs. “I think we want to keep the government open,” Trump said on Thursday, adding he thinks Congress can pass the funding legislation and perhaps also a revamped healthcare bill. Democratic support depends on what provisions Republicans demand in the bill. Democrats have signaled they would not cooperate if it contains money for one of Trump’s top priorities, a southwestern border wall intended to combat illegal immigration, or if it ends federal subsidies to help low-income people buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, which Republicans want to repeal. Democrats also want federal funds maintained for Planned Parenthood, which many Republicans oppose because the women’s healthcare provider performs abortions. Another obstacle would be if Trump demands large defense spending increases coupled with deep cuts to domestic programs Democrats want to protect. Late on Thursday, leading House Democrats were voicing skepticism a deal could be reached by the deadline. In a telephone call for House Democrats, Representative Nita Lowey, the senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said: “I don’t see how we can meet that deadline” and avoid having to pass a short-term extension, according to an aide on the call. The second-ranking House Democrat, Representative Steny Hoyer, told his fellow Democrats that they should only support such a short-term measure if a deal on long-term bill is reached and only finishing touches remained, the aide said. Republican leaders face a familiar balancing act: satisfying the party’s most conservative members while not alienating its moderates. Rules in the 100-seat Senate mean Trump’s party also would need the support of at least eight Democrats even if the Republicans remain unified, giving the opposition party leverage. House Republican leaders would need some Democratic votes if the most conservative lawmakers object to the bill, as they did to the healthcare plan championed by Speaker Paul Ryan. With congressional elections looming next year, Republicans acknowledge the stakes are high. “Even our most recalcitrant members understand that if you shut down the government while you’re running it and you control the House and the Senate, you can’t blame anybody but yourself,” said Representative Tom Cole, a senior House Appropriations Committee Republican. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said the Trump administration was willing to talk to Democrats about funding for Obamacare subsidies in exchange for their agreement to include some Trump priorities such as the wall, the defense hike and more money for immigration enforcement. “It is ripe for some type of negotiated agreement that gives the president some of his priorities and Democrats some of their priorities. So we think we’ve opened the door for that,” Mulvaney said. Democrats reacted negatively. “Everything had been moving smoothly until the administration moved in with a heavy hand. Not only are Democrats opposed to the wall, there is significant Republican opposition as well,” said Matt House, a spokesman for Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. The government was last forced to close in October 2013, when Republican Senator Ted Cruz and some of the most conservative House Republicans engineered a 17-day shutdown in an unsuccessful quest to kill Democratic former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law. “These kind of bills can’t pass without a reasonable number of the party of the minority in the Senate, and we are optimistic we will be able to work all that out,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said at the start of the spring recess. A deal is needed because Congress was unable to approve funding for the entire 2017 fiscal year that ends in September and has relied on stop-gap spending legislation. Congress has passed no major legislation since Trump took office in January, and he has ambitious hopes for major tax-cut legislation, infrastructure spending and other bills. With the difficulty passing a bill with so many divisive elements, lawmakers next week might need to buy time by passing a short-term bill lasting possibly one to three weeks, maintaining current spending levels. “That would be a setback: not catastrophic, but not a good thing, and a sign that you can’t govern,” Cole said. A federal closure would shutter National Park Service destinations like the Statue of Liberty, Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon. Government medical research would be suspended. Thousands of federal workers would be furloughed with thousands more working without pay until the shutdown ends, including homeland security personnel. Some veterans benefits could be suspended. Time would stand still in the U.S. Capitol with nobody on duty to wind the 200-year-old “Ohio Clock” just outside the Senate chamber. ",0
33207,WATCH: JUAN HERNANDEZ Tells How He Was CHASED And BEATEN By Anti-Trump COWARDS Who Sucker Punch People And Run In Packs,"This is what happens when you cross the Left. Sadly, this is how unions have been operating for decades. Mainstream America is about to see the ugly truth about the violent tactics of the Left. Anyone who could vote for a party who represents itself in such a manner should be ashamed. By Juan Hernandez   A Hispanic Trump supporter who lives in Santa Clara, CA.Last Thursday, I left work about 5 p.m. and drove to the San Jose Convention Center to hear Donald Trump speak.I ve been voting for conservative candidates for 15 years and a registered Republican since 2015. Now that the general election is underway, I believe Trump is the best candidate to fix our country s many problems, and I believe he s going to be the next commander in chief. So I was excited to hear him, and to show my support. Walking into the rally with a friend, I was a little wary: Trump s speech to the California Republican convention in Burlingame had been disrupted by protesters, and I wasn t sure whether to expect a similar scene in San Jose. But we got to the event early, and we must have been inside already by the time a crowd of protesters gathered in the streets near the convention center.The speech really got me energized. I got a new sense of appreciation and respect for Trump after a Bernie Sanders supporter interrupted him with a sign. Trump didn t blink:  Darling, there s no way he can win, but keep your sign high,  he said. That is the president that I want. It was great being around so many Republicans   in the Bay Area, we don t have a lot of that, so it was great to feel the camaraderie of being part of the GOP.My trouble began once the rally was over.My friend and I joined a crowd of Trump supporters who had all left the convention center around the same time. The garage where we had parked our car was right next to the building, but police were directing everyone around the block to another garage entrance instead. The farther we walked, the fewer Trump fans were with us   people began peeling off to go to restaurants or bars in the area, or to other garages nearby.And suddenly, there were protesters everywhere. Some were holding Mexican flags, or burning American ones. They were yelling  F  Trump!  at us and cornering us. Some of them started grabbing Trump supporters   they were going up and slugging people, sucker-punching people, just picking random people out. As much as we wanted to help, because our fellow Republicans were getting hit, I knew any moment that could be me. So my friend and I just kept walking   sometimes, we d be running. We saw police standing nearby, but they didn t do anything. That scared me, because I thought,  Okay, if I m next, there s going to be no cops. About a block from the garage entrance, we turned down the street and found a line of protesters standing in our way. To get back to our car, we d have to go through them. My friend and I were wearing  Make America Great Again  Trump hats. We were targets, and I was terrified. I could feel it coming   they would look at me and start walking up to me.Before we could make it into the garage, four or five men surrounded me, and another four surrounded my friend. They just started swinging. We swung back as best as we could. My main thing was I didn t want to fall; I didn t want to be knocked down. I m not a big guy, but I can defend myself as best I can if it s one on one   but not when they have so much anger against us.One of the blows caught my nose, and blood just started pouring out. That kind of stunned them, and they backed off a quick second. My adrenaline kicked in; I felt punches on my head, and I felt the punch that hit my nose, but I was in survival mode by then, and I didn t realize until later how much it hurt. I called my friend,  Okay, let s go! We ran into the parking garage, and we thought we were safe, but there were another few dozen protesters there, too. We got in our car and headed toward the exit. Some protesters jumped on the cars in front of us, but we eventually made it out. My friend drove me to the emergency room because my nose was pouring blood. I had a broken nose, and because I was covered with scratches, I had to get a tetanus shot, too. It took a lot out of me, much more than I realized at first; my headaches and soreness didn t start to go away until a week later.WATCH HERE:I still can t believe how poorly the police handled the protests. I live by Levi s Stadium, where the Super Bowl was. They had every single cop out there. Yet knowing the violence that s been breaking out near Trump rallies, San Jose wasn t prepared for it last week? So the Los Angeles chapter of Log Cabin Republicans held a news conference back in San Jose on Wednesday, to get some answers from the city s mayor, Sam Liccardo, and its police department about why they let me and other people get attacked and only made a few arrests.The whole thing made me angry. Here in Northern California, I feel like I m a unicorn: I m a gay Hispanic who s a Republican. It was much harder to come out as a Trump supporter than it was to come out as gay   the minute you say you re for Trump, everyone comes at you   but this has pushed me out of the closet about it completely.I should be able to vote for whom I want, and I shouldn t have to deal with violence to go hear my candidate speak. If people really want to protest at rallies, they should do it peacefully. I have a young niece and nephew, and I don t want them to think this is how politics work in the United States. We can t let our freedom of speech and our freedom of assembly be tarnished by politicians like those in San Jose who do not have our safety at heart.

58287,Exclusive: Pyongyang university to start fall classes without American staff after travel ban,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST), North Korea s only western-funded university, will start the fall semester without its dozens of American staff after failing to secure exemptions to a U.S. travel ban that starts on Friday.  PUST - home to the largest concentration of foreigners in the reclusive state - plans to revise courses and teaching schedules but its largely English-based curriculum will be heavily impacted, two sources familiar with PUST s operations said. PUST was founded in 2010 by a Korean American evangelical Christian with the goal of helping North Korea's future elite learn the skills to modernize the isolated country and engage with the outside world. (Graphic: Americans detained in North Korea - tmsnrt.rs/2pmE3ks) In mid-July, however, the U.S. State Department announced a ban on Americans traveling to North Korea following the death earlier this year of an American student who had been detained by the state while on a tour. It advised U.S. citizens living there to leave. Since then, tensions on the Korean peninsula have escalated significantly. Nuclear-armed North Korea has undertaken a number of provocative missile tests, including two intercontinental ballistic missile launches and one medium-range missile test this week that flew over Japan. Of the roughly 130 foreigners at PUST including faculty members, staffers and family members, about 60 were U.S. citizens, one of the sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation. None had received special permission to stay and all have now left Pyongyang.  The teaching activities and the unique  international English-based  character of the school are severely impacted by the U.S. travel ban and the decision of some other personnel not to return,  the source said.  The school, which is open about its Christian affiliation, has already been rocked by the detention of two of its staff members by the North Korean regime this year. The two were accused of acting against the interests of the state. U.S. officials announced the ban six weeks ago due to the risk Americans will be held for  long-term detention  in the country. The ban was imposed after U.S. student Otto Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda poster while on a tour last year.  Warmbier fell into a coma in custody and died soon after he was released to U.S. officials. The circumstances surrounding his death are not clear. The last major tour involving U.S. tourists flew out of North Korea on Thursday. The ban, similar to previous U.S. restrictions on travel to Iraq and Libya, makes North Korea the only country in the world Americans are currently banned by the State Department from visiting. Journalists and humanitarian workers can apply for special permission. But the U.S. government has yet to issue guidelines on how to obtain waivers, leaving PUST and educators uncertain how or when it might be possible to apply for exemptions, according to the people familiar with PUST s operations. The State Department said it was unable to comment on specific requests for exemptions.  Over the past several weeks, PUST leaders have tried to lobby for exemptions so that their work can continue, the sources said. The school is involved in ongoing discussions with U.S. officials, they added. The university was seen as a rare experiment in academic diplomacy with a country increasingly entirely isolated from the rest of the world due to tightening sanctions over its defiant pursuit of nuclear weapons programs. U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to stop Pyongyang achieving its goal of being able to fire a nuclear warhead to the United States and has warned the U.S. military is  locked and loaded  in case of North Korean provocation. Since PUST took in its first 50 students in 2010, the school has grown to about 500 undergraduate and 60 graduate students studying in mostly three departments - electronic and computer engineering, international finance and management and agriculture and life sciences.   A lot of effort has been spent over the past seven years that PUST has been operating. The prospect of this progress being undermined - even totally thwarted - as a consequence of the U.S. government action, is deeply worrying to everyone involved,  one of the sources said. ",0
44644,Vexation gives way to pragmatism as Wall Street girds for Trump,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street power brokers may have rolled their eyes in private when ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Steven Mnuchin agreed to be Donald Trump’s national finance chairman, but now they are lining up to meet him. Financial lobbyists and their bosses are hoping that Mnuchin and others Trump has enlisted as advisers will help convey their views and act as interpreters of the president-elect’s so far at times confusing messages. “This is different from a lot of elections in the past where you could say, ‘If so-and-so wins, this will be good for that industry and bad for that one,’” said Scott Bok, chief executive of investment bank Greenhill & Co Inc. “It’s not like Trump laid out a clear set of policies where you can say, ‘This is good for these types of companies and bad for those.’” Bankers and their lobbyists are hoping their path to influence will become clearer in the coming weeks with Trump’s cabinet appointments. “It is a matter now of getting to the people who are coming in and convincing them of the benefits of some moderate deregulation to foster economic growth,” said one industry executive, who declined to speak publicly about Trump. During the presidential campaign, many people on Wall Street had supported his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton viewing her as a pragmatist and a stabilizing force.    Despite castigating hedge fund managers for “getting away with murder” on their taxes and making a vague pledge to strip big banks of their profitable trading arms, Trump has surrounded himself with financiers including Mnuchin and hedge fund firm bosses John Paulson and Anthony Scaramucci. At the time some of their peers thought they were taking an opportunistic punt as they viewed Trump as unpredictable and populist and were vexed by his snipes at the industry. Six months later, government-relations executives for big banks are scrambling to secure meetings with them as well as key staffers on Capitol Hill’s important financial committees, in hopes they can provide a sympathetic ear for the industry. “That work begins immediately,” said one industry lobbyist who was not authorized to speak publicly. Trump’s lack of political experience and his scattershot pronouncements have made him a wild card for big business, making private contacts with his inner circle especially critical.     On bank regulation, Trump has promised to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform law and implement a new, possibly tougher one, but offered few details on what it would look like. Although Trump’s outsider status helped him win, he has turned to some well-known Washington insiders when looking to fill vacancies at U.S. financial regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Former Republican SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, who founded and heads the regulatory consulting firm Patomak Global Partners LLC, is leading the transition team for financial regulation, according to a person familiar with the matter. Come January, Trump is expected to designate SEC Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar as acting chair. It is unclear if Trump will make the role permanent or later tap someone new. SEC Chair Mary Jo White, an independent appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013, is expected to leave the agency when Obama’s term is over. Mnuchin is seen as the likely pick for Treasury Secretary. He did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. KBW policy analyst Brian Gardner predicts Vice President-elect Mike Pence will have a major influence on who gets appointed to key roles, and will choose “orthodox Republicans” who are equally familiar as some others in Trump’s circle. In an emailed statement, Scaramucci said Trump’s reputation for unpredictability was undeserved. “While spending time with President-elect Trump during the campaign I got to know a very analytical and compassionate person,” Scaramucci, founder and a co-managing partner of investment firm SkyBridge Capital, said.  Several policy experts predicted Trump and the new Congress will water down some financial reform rules, such as the Durbin amendment that limits bank fees or the Volcker rule against proprietary trading. They uniformly expect diminished power, if not a gutting of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But the Trump administration may also propose regulations that are more problematic, such as extremely high capital requirements or a revival of the Depression-era Glass Steagall law that broke up big banks. Mnuchin, however, was cited by many as a ray of hope. Although he has not publicly expressed opinions on financial regulation or fiscal policy, bankers and lobbyists said they felt reassured by his experience on Wall Street. “I can’t imagine that his goal would be to destroy Goldman Sachs,” said the industry executive, “which is better than some.” ",0
15613,Report: Caitlyn Jenner Feels ’Liberated’ after Sex Reassignment Surgery,"Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, has undergone successful sex reassignment surgery, according to a book of memoirs set to be released later this month. [According to excerpts published by Radar Online, the    Jenner went under the knife for a “final surgery” in January of this year, just over two years after coming out as transgender in a blockbuster interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015.  “The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated,” Jenner reportedly writes in Secrets of My Life, a book of memoirs due out April 25. “I am telling you because I believe in candor,” Jenner reportedly writes in the book. “So all of you can stop staring. You want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it. ” In April 2015, Jenner  —   who earned a gold medal in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympic games in Montreal  —   told Diane Sawyer in a   interview that he had always been confused about his gender identity. “I am a woman,” Jenner said at the time. “It’s not like I’ve been dressing up like a woman, it’s like I’ve spent my whole life dressing like a man. ” Following the reveal, Jenner appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair, was named Glamour magazine’s “Woman of the Year” and was awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2015 ESPY Awards. Jenner also starred in the reality series I Am Cait, which ran for two seasons on E!. In the upcoming memoir, Jenner reportedly writes that the decision to go under the knife was “complex,” but ultimately, “it’s just a penis. ” “I just want to have all the right parts,” Jenner reportedly writes. “I am also tired of tucking the damn thing in all the time. ” Jenner still appears regularly on the E! series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.

1172,Hard Times in Venezuela Breed Malaria as Desperate Flock to Mines - The New York Times,"THE ALBINO MINE, Venezuela  —   The 12th time Reinaldo Balocha got malaria, he hardly rested at all. With the fever still rattling his body, he threw a pick ax over his shoulder and got back to work  —   smashing stones in an illegal gold mine. As a computer technician from a big city, Mr. Balocha was   for the mines, his soft hands used to working keyboards, not the earth. But Venezuela’s economy collapsed on so many levels that inflation had obliterated his salary, along with his hopes of preserving a   life. So, like tens of thousands of other people from across the country, Mr. Balocha came to these open, swampy mines scattered across the jungle, looking for a future. Here, waiters, office workers, taxi drivers, college graduates and even civil servants on vacation from their government jobs are out panning for   gold, all under the watchful eyes of an armed group that taxes them and threatens to tie them to posts if they disobey. It is a society turned upside down, a place where educated people abandon   jobs in the city for dangerous, backbreaking work in muddy pits, desperate to make ends meet. And it comes with a steep price: Malaria, long driven to the fringes of the country, is festering in the mines and back with a vengeance. Venezuela was the first nation in the world to be certified by the World Health Organization for eradicating malaria in its most populated areas, beating the United States and other developed countries to that milestone in 1961. It was a huge accomplishment for a small nation, one that helped pave Venezuela’s development as an oil power and fueled hopes that a model to stamp out malaria across the globe was at hand. Since then, the world has dedicated enormous amounts of time and money to beating back the disease, with deaths plummeting by 60 percent in places with malaria in recent years, according to the W. H. O. But in Venezuela, the clock is running backward. The country’s economic turmoil has brought malaria back, sweeping the disease out of the remote jungle areas where it quietly persisted and spreading it around the nation at levels not seen in Venezuela for 75 years, medical experts say. It all starts with the mines. With the economy in tatters, at least 70, 000 people from all walks of life have been streaming into this mining region over the past year, said Jorge Moreno, a leading mosquito expert in Venezuela. As they hunt for gold in watery pits, the perfect breeding ground for the mosquitoes that spread the disease, they are catching malaria by the tens of thousands. Then, with the disease in their blood, they return home to Venezuela’s cities. But because of the economic collapse, there is often no medicine and little fumigation to prevent mosquitoes there from biting them and passing malaria to others, sickening tens of thousands more people and leaving entire towns desperate for help. The economic breakdown has “triggered a great migration in Venezuela, and right behind it is the spread of malaria,” said Dr. Moreno, a researcher at a   laboratory in the mining region. “With this breakdown comes a disease that is cooked in the same pot. ” Once out of the mines, malaria spreads quickly. Five hours away in Ciudad Guayana, a rusting former industrial boomtown where many are now jobless and have taken to wildcatting in the mines, a crowd of 300 people packed the waiting room of a clinic in May. All had symptoms of the disease: fevers, icy chills and uncontrollable tremors. There were no lights because the government had cut power to save electricity. There were no medicines because the Health Ministry had not delivered any. Health workers administered blood tests with their bare hands because they were out of gloves. Maribel Supero clutched her    son as he trembled, unable to speak. José Castro held his    daughter as she screamed. Griselda Bello, who works at the clinic, waved her hands helplessly and told yet another patient to hold on a bit longer. The pills had run out. There was nothing she could do. “Come back tomorrow at 10 a. m.,” she said. “My God,” the patient said. “Someone might die by then. ” “Indeed, they might,” she said. In the nearby town of Pozo Verde, residents said malaria had swept in after miners began returning home sick, the government fumigators having vanished two years ago. Now, the public high school has become an incubating ground of its own: A quarter of its 400 students have contracted malaria since November. “You would think we would do something  —   a cordon, a quarantine,” said Arebalo Enríquez, the principal of the school, who contracted malaria, as did his wife, mother and seven other members of his family. Officially, the spread of malaria in Venezuela has become a state secret. The government has not published epidemiological reports on the disease in the past year, and it says there is no crisis. But the most recent internal figures, obtained by The New York Times from Venezuelan doctors involved in compiling it, confirms a surge is underway. In the first six months of the year, malaria cases rose 72 percent, to a total of 125, 000, according to the figures. The disease cut a wide path through the country, with cases present in more than half of its 23 states. And among the malaria strains present here is Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite that causes the most fatal form of the disease. “It is a situation of national shame,” said Dr. José Oletta, a former Venezuelan health minister who lives in the capital, Caracas, where malaria cases are now appearing, too. “I was seeing this kind of thing when I was a medical student a   ago. It hurts me. The disease had disappeared. ” In El Dique, a rural town where malaria was largely unknown until two years ago, Juana García, 66, sat outside her home, newly widowed since her husband fell ill with the disease and died. She hardly spoke or moved from her chair. “She will keep fighting,” said her daughter Ana María Padrón. Inside Ms. Padrón’s adobe home, her two sons were fighting malaria, too. Almost like clockwork, their fevers began in the morning: at 8 a. m. for Omar, who is 8 at 11 for Aristides, who is 7. The family has found no medicine. The boys have only painkillers. “We pray,” their mother said. The illegal mines spill out over dozens of miles, leaving a pockmarked stretch of earth where the jungle gives way to countless craters and scars. Some are no more than tiny pools where two men sift the mud with pans, like a scene from the California goldfields more than a century ago. Others drain wide marshes with tangled networks of tubes and pumps. In another spot, hundreds of wildcatters had dug out a gaping maw of red and white soil. It sinks 15 stories deep and runs the length of a football field. They call it Cuatro Muertos, or Four Dead Men. It was not supposed to be this way. The gold reserves were once controlled by a Canadian company before President Hugo Chávez expropriated them and pledged to use their profits to fund his   revolution. But the expropriation followed the pattern of mismanagement and neglect that many others did during the Chávez era. The state eventually abandoned the territory around the mine, and the potentially lucrative profits. Wildcatters have moved in, and so have the armed groups that now call themselves the law here. But at least there is food. As the country convulses from food shortages and riots, as hungry mobs ransack grocery stores, restaurants and bakeries, the mining town of Las Claritas, only a short drive from the mines, lives in a state of relative plenty. Restaurants offer full menus. Street markets are packed with fruit. Pickups drive by loaded with pumpkins. In a country where soap is in short supply, a dozen brands are on sale in a   grocery store, where seven models of   televisions are also available. Miners dish out fat wads of their gold earnings in cash, which run through a   machine. The promise of a different Venezuela  —   one where there is ample food and work that pays enough  —   led Yudani González to abandon a program to become a preschool teacher in Ciudad Bolívar, the provincial capital, where unemployment is rampant. Instead, she headed to a ramshackle jungle camp, where she cooks for miners with one hand and cares for her two young children with the other. “Here, you can get ahead,” Ms. González said, washing her    daughter in a plastic bucket on the counter as she cooked. Danneris Flores, a government employee moonlighting as a mining camp cook, sat nearby. She is an administrative assistant in a   health clinic, but Venezuela’s currency has tumbled so far that her salary amounts to only about $1 a day at the current street value. So she asked for a vacation  —   and used it to work for a couple of weeks at the mines. Her    who works for the state oil company, Pdvsa, does the same thing. In a short stint at the mines, Ms. Flores said she could earn twice her monthly wages. She counted the days until she would be home to see her three children, whom she had left after “closing my eyes and making my heart small. ” “I never imagined that I would work in a mine,” she said to Ms. González as they served a meal. “Before, people thought of going to school. ” A miner walked in to greet the women and said he had recently watched someone collapse and die of malaria on her way to a market. Ms. González said she had come down with it four times herself. Her    she said, has had it three times. “They charge you two grams of gold for medicine,” she said. “You pay what they ask. ” Not everyone can find medication, even with gold earnings. José Yoel Castillo stumbled to the doorstep of the malaria clinic in Las Claritas, carried on the shoulders of two relatives as he convulsed and was unable to speak. He had been making a living in the town of Caicara del Orinoco, driving passengers on the back of a motorcycle. But an armed gang took the vehicle, and Mr. Castillo could not afford a new one. So he came to the mines. He quickly found work and money  —   even malaria medication the first time he became ill. But when the symptoms came a second time, he could not find treatment anywhere. “Some people can just keep working through it,” said his    Alejandro López. “But others can’t. ” Even with money in their pockets, the miners know the dangers of going back home. Josué Guevara, 20, gave up last November on his university studies in industrial engineering in a city about 10 hours away. He once pictured himself as a manager at the   aluminum company, Alcasa. But his family members who worked there could barely afford food, he said. “Now I have other goals,” he said, standing at the edge of the Cuatro Muertos mines, where he lives and works today. Using gasoline and other chemicals to extract the gold, Mr. Guevara earned 500, 000 bolívars  —   around $500 at   exchange rates, about 33 times the country’s minimum wage  —   during a lucky   stretch. But when he got malaria this spring, he did what many miners do: He returned to his hometown to recover, bringing the disease with him. “Everything has its risks,” he said. On the other side of the vast pit, Pedro Pérez, 38, sat in a structure made of tree poles and tarp where he sleeps with 10 other miners. He tested positive for malaria twice in March. The third time he fell ill, he did not bother to get tested. “I was lying here and I felt the same symptoms,” he said. He, too, went back home  —   to the provincial capital, Ciudad Bolívar, where his mother eventually caught malaria, as well. “It’s coming from us,” Mr. Pérez said. Mr. Pérez remembered his life before he came to the mines last fall: He was a supervisor at a   metal refinery, he said. He owned a     house and a 2005 Ford Focus. He and his wife, a lawyer, once jetted off on   getaways to Isla Margarita, a tropical island off the north coast of Venezuela. Yet even before he lost his job last year and was unable to find another, Venezuela’s plummeting currency had whittled his salary down to about $26 a month. He eventually left home for the mine. “I am still not used to washing myself every day in a river of dirty water,” he said. “I thought I had a good life. ” A few weeks ago, his wife came to Las Claritas to buy the food and soap she could not find in Ciudad Bolívar. The couple spent three nights together in a miner’s hostel. After she left, Mr. Pérez felt the strains on their marriage. “‘I know it’s hard for you,’ I tell her, ‘but we have to accept this new reality,’” he said. Back in Las Claritas, at a table in a dark brothel that smelled of alcohol, sat Angélica, a young woman with long black hair whose parents do not know she has turned to prostitution to make her living. She left the eastern city of Maturín three months ago when riots erupted because food had gone scarce. “Before, you waited in line for hours, but you got something,” said Angélica, who did not give her last name, ashamed of her work. “But now there is nothing there. ” Today she earns the equivalent of $40 when a miner wants to spend the night with her. More often, the money comes in increments of $8, when a customer wants to have sex and leave a short time later. At times, she said, it may be a stranger who is trembling with fever, unable to perform because of malaria. Other times, it is the owner of one of the Chinese grocery stores. The men come from all corners of the country. “The most difficult part of this life is being with someone who you do not love,” she said. Venezuela rose only after malaria declined. It was the 1920s and another resource had set off a bonanza  —   the black gold of oil, discovered in massive supply. But a vast malaria hot zone, then   of Venezuela, stood between the country and its riches. The deadly scenes were later immortalized in “Dead Homes,” a 1955 Venezuelan novel about the rural epidemics of malaria and the waves of migration to the country’s oil fields. Freeing the country of malaria became pivotal to Venezuela’s development, said Dr. Oletta, the former health minister. “Only once malaria was gone, roads could come, industry,” he said. “This was a sick country, and when it got well, things changed. ” That transformative effort was led by Dr. Arnoldo Gabaldón, the former health minister who began one of the world’s first   efforts to eradicate malaria and who became a national hero during his age. Teams across the Venezuelan countryside built irrigation ditches to drain pools of standing water, distributed quinine and constructed cinder block homes in rural areas so that mosquitoes had fewer places to breed. Dr. Gabaldón founded a research center in the city of Maracay, outside of Caracas and itself a malaria zone at the time, to broaden the mission and train officials from Latin America and Africa. But it was his use of insecticides  —   initially DDT, then other substances  —   that began to turn the tide. The walls of nearly every rural home in the country were sprayed, a technique that killed mosquitoes when they landed to rest. Fumigators would leave an envelope showing the date they would return. By 1949, malaria deaths had fallen drastically: to nine per 100, 000 people from 300. By the time Mr. Chávez assumed the presidency 50 years later and began to carry out his   vision for Venezuela, the regimented system of Dr. Gabaldón had long faded, though malaria still appeared to be confined to a few rural areas. But the restructuring of the economy under Mr. Chávez and his followers, including a growing dependence on oil revenue and a system of currency controls restricting American dollars, would eventually change that. In 2014 and 2015, as oil prices collapsed and the government scrambled for money to pay for goods, services and imports, there were long shortages of chloroquine and primaquine, two drugs used for Plasmodium vivax, the most prevalent malaria parasite in the Americas. By 2016, doctors said there were shortages of nearly all   drugs, most notably a drug cocktail for the deadly falciparum strain that costs just several dollars for a full round of treatment. Though debilitating and even fatal, malaria is easily treatable with the proper medication. Dr. Leopoldo Villegas, an international malaria expert in Bangkok, said the government also relied on outdated methods like outdoor fogging with insecticides, which had unproven effects on adult mosquitoes that transmit malaria. And because it was not publishing epidemiological reports of new malaria cases or deaths, it was unclear how much medicine was needed each year. “This is an emergency, this is an outbreak, and it’s not being dealt with by the government this way,” Dr. Villegas said, adding that the Venezuelan government had repeatedly denied the extent of malaria’s resurgence to international organizations that could help prevent its spread. Gustavo Bretas, a Brazilian malaria expert, said that Venezuela once trained people throughout the region in malaria prevention. But Venezuela’s inability to contain its own outbreak means that it now plays the opposite role: It poses a threat to the countries around it, particularly Brazil, where there are also illegal gold mines. “It’s starting to spill over into neighboring countries,” he said, adding that the lack of government statistics made the extent of the problem hard to assess. Venezuela’s Health Ministry did not respond to requests for an interview, including a letter delivered to its offices. Oscar Noya now works in Dr. Gabaldón’s old laboratory in Caracas under a picture of his mentor in a suit and bow tie. On a recent day, malaria patients once again sat on the steps, most having arrived from the mines. Fifteen had come on a recent morning 12 of them tested positive for the disease. Dr. Noya tries to make do without many vital drugs, like artesunate, listed by the W. H. O. as an essential medicine for the treatment of severe cases of falciparum malaria. He has only three vials of it left. He needs six to treat a single patient with a serious case. One recent night, a gang entered one of his malaria laboratories and stole the computers, one of about 20 attacks this year against the Tropical Medical Institute where he works, Dr. Noya said. He wonders if the groups are aligned with the government. “We believe this is no more than intimidation because we’re not quiet and we won’t be quiet,” he said, referring to public advocacy about malaria and the spread of other diseases. Dr. Noya put away his vials of artesunate as more patients gathered outside. He looked up with an air of desperation. “Dr. Gabaldón would have died of a heart attack if he’d seen what is happening,” he said. Despite the constant churn of workers from across Venezuela, there is a clear order to the mines. It is enforced by an armed group known as the Union. One of the Union’s bosses came to the mines years ago to work as a dentist. He still does. But the squads of patrolmen on motorbikes who dominate this place are the real source of his wealth and power. He sports gold chains, two gold teeth  —   and brass knuckles made of gold. After the government abandoned them, the mines soon grew again, this time at an unruly pace as wildcatters plowed into the forest, creating pools of stagnant water and a population of easy prey for the mosquitoes that breed in them, paving the way for the explosion of malaria. Sitting on his patio, the boss, who declined to be named because he could be arrested by the government, took pride in what he said was the Union’s ability to fill in for the vacuum left by the state. Yes, he acknowledged, the punishments the group meted out could be gruesome, like shooting off a man’s hand when he stole, or tying others to posts at the entrance of town with a sign detailing the offense committed. But he argued that the discipline kept crime in the camps low and allowed miners to go about their business in peace  —   another aspect of life that has steadily eroded in Venezuela’s dangerous cities. “To get justice from the police is a joke,” he said. “You have to get your own justice. ” Eduardo Medina agreed. A former pharmacist, he said he had left the drugstore where he worked in the state of Zulia a year ago to start mining because he saw the economic crisis spread and law and order slip away. “At any time, you might go out and someone would put a pistol in your face for your phone, or knife your mother,” Mr. Medina said in his tent. “Crime is under control here. They charge us, but they solve the problems, too. ” But the appearance of calm is deceiving. Storms rage in other places where rivals vie for control of the mines. In March, at least 17 miners were killed in what the authorities believed was one such dispute. Mr. Medina, on a break, looked down into the pit where his fellow miners labored. “At any moment, you can be killed in Zulia,” he said. “But you can be killed here, too. ” For all the challenges of keeping order, the boss said, malaria was even harder. “On malaria, we are screwed,” he said. The task of monitoring the disease seems to have been delegated to people like a state health employee named Miguel Martínez, who sat at a lonely post a short walk from a brothel near the mines, examining blood samples from miners. Under his microscope, a dye had stained the malaria parasite a dark purple. The log beside him showed that half of the patients who had visited him that day had tested positive for malaria. Like many health workers in this country, Mr. Martínez was exasperated. “Just as there are no rice and beans in this country, there are no medicines,” he said. Evening approached at the mine, the time when the Anopheles mosquito begins to feed. Dusk settled over a clapboard Pentecostal church, where parishioners speak in tongues, and past a    circus tent promising alcohol and a strip tease. Under a tarp, five men hammered away at a vein of quartz, which they would grind down and sift for gold. Others waded up to their shoulders in pools laden with heavy metals like mercury, angling tubes to pump the mud. Tropical birds flew in the distance. “Is the malaria really coming from the miners?” asked Aníbal Flores, 28, a miner who sleeps in a hammock between two poles beside the mine. “But where else can we go to make money? The city? There is no food there. ” Lately, many Venezuelans have taken matters into their own hands. Five hours away in the newly infected town of El Dique, residents were collecting 100 bolívars from each household to hire a fumigator to come spray their homes. In the mine, where malaria tests are sometimes unavailable, miners said they had developed an exam of their own: Drink two bottles of beer. If a sharp pain is felt afterward in the liver, where the parasites reside, then the patient has malaria, the test goes. Health officials said the measure was futile. Still, Mr. Balocha, the former computer technician who works in the Albino Mine, lives by it. Miners call it an “artisanal test. ” He was sick once again, waiting for medicine at a   fence on the edge of a clinic. He recalled the words of his uncle, who phoned him a year ago when Mr. Balocha found his salary as a computer technician to be worthless in the city of Valencia. “There is money here,” said the uncle, who was mining then. “You have to know how to find it. ” Mr. Balocha started as a “palero,” a stone breaker, getting the smallest cut of the take. But it was still more than what his salary bought in the city after inflation had whittled it away, he said. He recalled the first time he got malaria, too, the “chills like you were lying down between two blocks of ice. ” “The first time you get malaria is the ugliest,” Mr. Balocha said. “You can’t control the tremors. You feel like you will die. You feel like you are a zombie. ” But he would become a millionaire here, he joked, and one day he would head to Europe  —   with a Latin American woman, he added  —   far from the mines, the malaria and the Union. He sighed, looking up at the sky. “In the mine, happiness is only temporary,” he said.",0
19700,Tribunal Rejects Beijing’s Claims in South China Sea - The New York Times,"BEIJING  —   An international tribunal in The Hague delivered a sweeping rebuke on Tuesday of China’s behavior in the South China Sea, including its construction of artificial islands, and found that its expansive claim to sovereignty over the waters had no legal basis. The landmark case, brought by the Philippines, was seen as an important crossroads in China’s rise as a global power and in its rivalry with the United States, and it could force Beijing to reconsider its assertive tactics in the region or risk being labeled an international outlaw. It was the first time the Chinese government had been summoned before the international justice system. In its most significant finding, the tribunal rejected China’s argument that it enjoys historic rights over most of the South China Sea. That could give the governments of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam more leverage in their own maritime disputes with Beijing. The tribunal also said that China had violated international law by causing “irreparable harm” to the marine environment, endangering Philippine ships and interfering with Philippine fishing and oil exploration. “It’s an overwhelming victory. We won on every significant point,” said the Philippines’ chief counsel in the case, Paul S. Reichler. But while the decision is legally binding, there is no mechanism for enforcing it, and China, which refused to participate in the tribunal’s proceedings, reiterated on Tuesday that it would not abide by it. Speaking at a meeting with European leaders, President Xi Jinping was defiant, reasserting China’s claim to sovereignty over the South China Sea “since ancient times,” the   People’s Daily reported. His remarks echoed a statement from the Foreign Ministry. The tribunal’s decision “is invalid and has no binding force,” the ministry said. “China does not accept or recognize it. ” The foreign secretary of the Philippines, Perfecto Yasay Jr. welcomed the ruling as “significant” and called on “all those concerned to exercise restraint and sobriety. ” The five judges and legal experts on the tribunal ruled unanimously, and the decision was so heavily in favor of the Philippines that there were fears about how the Chinese leadership would react. Many in the region worry that Beijing will accelerate its efforts to assert control over the South China Sea, which includes vital trade routes and fishing waters as well as possible oil and mineral deposits. “Xi Jinping has lost face here, and it will be difficult for China to do nothing,” said Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “I expect a very tough reaction from China, since it has lost on almost every point. There is virtually nothing that it has won. ” The Philippines filed its case in 2013, after China seized a reef over which both countries claim sovereignty. There has been speculation that Beijing might respond to the decision by building an artificial island at the reef, Scarborough Shoal, a move that could set off a conflict with the Philippines and its treaty ally, the United States. The State Department spokesman, John Kirby, said Washington expected China to comply with the ruling. “The world is watching to see if China is really the global power it professes itself to be and the responsible power that it professes itself to be,” he said. The main issue before the panel was the legality of China’s claim to waters within a “  line” that appears on official Chinese maps and encircles as much as 90 percent of the South China Sea, an area the size of Mexico. The Philippines had asked the tribunal to find the claim to be in violation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which both China and the Philippines have ratified. In its decision, the tribunal said any historic rights to the sea that China had previously enjoyed “were extinguished” by the treaty, which lays out rules for drawing zones of control over the world’s oceans based on distances to coastlines. The panel added that while China had used islands in the sea in the past, it had never exercised exclusive authority over the waters. The panel also concluded that several disputed rocks and reefs in the South China Sea were too small for China to claim control of economic activities in the waters around them. As a result, it found, China was engaged in unlawful behavior in Philippine waters, including activities that had aggravated the dispute. The tribunal cited China’s construction of a large artificial island on an atoll known as Mischief Reef. China has built a military airstrip, naval berths and sports fields on the island, but the tribunal ruled that it was in Philippine waters. The judges also said that Beijing had violated international law by causing “severe harm to the coral reef environment” and by failing to prevent Chinese fishermen from harvesting endangered sea turtles and other species “on a substantial scale. ” In an early indication of the regional response, Vietnam  —   which has fraternal Communist ties to China but also significant territorial disputes with it, including over oil exploration rights  —   quickly issued a statement endorsing the tribunal’s decision. China has argued that the tribunal had no jurisdiction in the case. Because the sovereignty of reefs and islands in the sea is disputed, Beijing asserted, the tribunal could not decide on competing claims to the surrounding waters. The treaty covers only maritime disputes, not land disputes. In a tough speech in Washington last week, a former senior Chinese official, Dai Bingguo, said that the findings would amount to no more than “waste paper” and that China would not back down from its activities in the South China Sea even in the face of a fleet of American aircraft carriers. But with the geopolitical stakes high, Mr. Dai also counseled moderation, saying that the situation in the South China Sea “must cool down. ” The issue could have ramifications for domestic politics in China. Mr. Xi has made defense of maritime claims a central part of the governing Communist Party’s narrative that it has restored the nation to global greatness after long periods of humiliation by bigger powers. Any challenge to that narrative is seen in Beijing as a challenge to the party’s rule. On Wednesday morning, an escalating propaganda campaign in China against the tribunal reached a new pitch, with all the major news outlets condemning the decision and trumpeting China’s refusal to be back down. “We do not claim an inch of land that does not belong to us, but we won’t give up any patch that is ours,” said a   editorial in The People’s Daily, which ridiculed the tribunal as a “lackey of some outside forces” that would be remembered as a “laughingstock in human history. ” Some Chinese commentators have said in recent days that the leadership may respond with immediate military maneuvers in the South China Sea. “Whether it will be significant or large scale I cannot say,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. China is hosting the Group of 20 summit meeting in September, a major international forum that it hopes will proceed without the distraction of conflict. But Mr. Shi said he was not sure the government had “that kind of patience” to wait until after the gathering before taking some sort of action. In a surprising opinion article on the India Today website over the weekend, a professor of international relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, Shen Dingli, wrote that Beijing needed to “revise its stance” and “employ a more effective approach” that maintained China’s “  ‘smiling’ image. ” The new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has signaled that he will be more accommodating toward China than was his predecessor, Benigno S. Aquino III. The case before the tribunal was filed at the initiative of Mr. Aquino, whose term ended June 30. Soon after the case was filed, China began building artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago, much of which is claimed by the Philippines, in a move that many saw as a demonstration of contempt for the international court system. Experts in international law said that negotiations could be the most positive outcome of the case. In 1986, some noted, the United States ignored a ruling from the International Court of Justice that declared its mining of the harbors of Nicaragua to be illegal. Washington had not ratified the Convention on the Law of the Sea, and it still has not. But the ruling 30 years ago by the judges in The Hague emboldened congressional critics to cut funds for the Reagan administration’s campaign against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, and it galvanized countries in Central America to seek a settlement of the conflict. China is not expected to vacate or dismantle the artificial islands it has built. That makes the legal arguments important, analysts said. “ “The tribunal rulings will move the goal posts towards the Philippines and the smaller countries,” said Markus Gehring, a lecturer in law at Cambridge University. In Manila, the former foreign secretary, Albert F. del Rosario, who brought the case after years of failed negotiations with China, said the path was now open for a lasting settlement of disputes in the South China Sea. “The award provides a basis to further talks and cooperation to encompass all parties, including China,” he said.",0
39839,Russia's response to new U.S. sanctions must be 'painful': lawmaker,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia should prepare a “painful” response to new U.S. sanctions to be imposed on Moscow, Konstantin Kosachyov, a prominent member of the upper house of Russia’s parliament, said on his Facebook page on Wednesday. “Judging by the unanimous vote in the U.S. House of Representatives on the sanctions package against Russia, Iran and North Korea, there will be no breakthrough (in U.S.-Russian relations)... In fact, further degradation of bilateral cooperation is becoming inevitable,” Kosachyov said.  The U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday to slap new sanctions on Russia and force President Donald Trump to obtain lawmakers’ permission before easing any sanctions on Moscow.

55833,Russia accuses CNN International of violating Russian media law,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia s communications regulator on Friday accused U.S. TV channel CNN International of violating Russian media law and said it had summoned the broadcaster s representatives in connection with the matter. The Russian foreign ministry accused Washington on Thursday of putting unwarranted pressure on the U.S operations of Kremlin-backed media outlet RT, and warned that Moscow could take tit-for-tat measures. President Vladimir Putin told a meeting of Russia s Security Council on Friday that Russian media outlets working abroad were facing growing and unacceptable pressure, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, said in a statement on its website that it would look at warning CNN about the alleged violations, which it said also breached the terms of its broadcast license. It did not say what breaches of Russian laws the U.S. broadcaster had made, adding it would continue its  systematic monitoring  of foreign mass media outlets registered in Russia. Asked if the regulator s move was politically motivated, Roskomnadzor head Alexander Zharov, was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying:  I don t work in a political agency. I work in a regulatory service.   Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday the U.S. authorities were demanding that Russian state-controlled broadcaster Russia Today (RT) be registered as a  foreign agent  in the United States. She said that move endangered the safety of the channel s staff, because it included an obligation to disclose their personal data.  In the atmosphere of a witch hunt unfolding in the United States, this may present a real threat,  she said. Putin, meeting permanent members of his Security Council,  touched upon the issue of ongoing and at times growing pressure on Russian mass media outlets in some foreign countries , Peskov told a conference call with reporters.  It was stressed that such pressure on Russian media is unacceptable,  he added. He did not name the countries where the Kremlin was concerned Russian media were coming under pressure.    The Foreign Ministry s Zakharova said any move made against Russian media working in the United States  will get a tit-for-tat response .  And who it falls on, this should be easy for Washington to work out. The clock is ticking,  she said at a weekly briefing on Thursday. ",0
32745,WOW! HILLARY SPILLS THE BEANS On Funding Terrorists…The Press Is Silent [Video],"Hillary Clinton tells about funding the terrorists who would help defeat the Russians   most of this is true but in typical Hillary fashion she changes the story and doesn t mention Reagan s Strategic Defense Initiative. The SDI aka  Star Wars  was a big part in the defeat as well. You can guarantee you ll never see this video clip on the main stream media! During the 1970 s the CIA used the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt as a barrier, both to thwart Soviet expansion and prevent the spread of Marxist ideology among the Arab masses. The United States also openly supported Sarekat Islam against Sukarno in Indonesia, and supported the Jamaat-e-Islami terror group against Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in Pakistan. Last but certainly not least, there is Al Qaeda.Lest we forget, the CIA gave birth to Osama Bin Laden and breastfed his organization during the 1980 s. Former British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, told the House of Commons that Al Qaeda was unquestionably a product of Western intelligence agencies. Mr. Cook explained that Al Qaeda, which literally means an abbreviation of  the database  in Arabic, was originally the computer database of the thousands of Islamist extremists, who were trained by the CIA and funded by the Saudis, in order to defeat the Russians in Afghanistan.America s relationship with Al Qaeda has always been a love-hate affair. Depending on whether a particular Al Qaeda terrorist group in a given region furthers American interests or not, the U.S. State Department either funds or aggressively targets that terrorist group. Even as American foreign policy makers claim to oppose Muslim extremism, they knowingly foment it as a weapon of foreign policy.The Islamic State is its latest weapon that, much like Al Qaeda, is certainly backfiring. ISIS recently rose to international prominence after its thugs began beheading American journalists. Now the terrorist group controls an area the size of the United Kingdom.In order to understand why the Islamic State has grown and flourished so quickly, one has to take a look at the organization s American-backed roots. The 2003 American invasion and occupation of Iraq created the pre-conditions for radical Sunni groups, like ISIS, to take root. America, rather unwisely, destroyed Saddam Hussein s secular state machinery and replaced it with a predominantly Shiite administration. The U.S. occupation caused vast unemployment in Sunni areas, by rejecting socialism and closing down factories in the naive hope that the magical hand of the free market would create jobs.FLASHBACK: Hillary Clinton Received Secret Memo Stating Obama Admin Support for ISISUnder the new U.S.-backed Shiite regime, working class Sunni s lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. Unlike the white Afrikaners in South Africa, who were allowed to keep their wealth after regime change, upper class Sunni s were systematically dispossessed of their assets and lost their political influence. Rather than promoting religious integration and unity, American policy in Iraq exacerbated sectarian divisions and created a fertile breading ground for Sunni discontent, from which Al Qaeda in Iraq took root.The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) used to have a different name: Al Qaeda in Iraq. After 2010 the group rebranded and refocused its efforts on Syria.Via: GR",1
5794,"Without Bold Agenda, Warn Progressives, A Clinton Presidency Won’t Stand Chance","Without Bold Agenda, Warn Progressives, A Clinton Presidency Won’t Stand Chance Posted on Nov 3, 2016 
By Lauren McCauley / Common Dreams Progressive leaders, including Sen. Bernie Sanders and 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben, promise there will no honeymoon period for the centrist Democrat should she be elected. ( Daniel / (CC BY-ND 2.0) ) 
While the whole country appears to be on edge ahead of next week’s presidential election, the Left is “increasingly confident” that, should a Hillary Clinton presidency come to pass, the Democratic nominee won’t be able to turn her back on progressive campaign promises—as many argue President Barack Obama did—because she will need that grassroots support if she hopes to stay in office beyond four years. 
“If she wants to be more than a one-term president, she’s going to have to work with the left. Period,” Murshed Zaheed, political director of CREDO, told The Hill for a new report published Thursday. 
Speaking with progressive activists, The Hill reports that the Left is entering a post-election season “emboldened and empowered,” and ready to fight for implementation of the Democratic platform, said to be the most progressive in the party’s history. 
And unlike Obama, a hypothetical President Clinton won’t be in a position to attempt a “‘post-partisan’ approach to seeking deals with Republicans.”

“We’re hoping that she will be smart enough to know that if she were to go that route…there’s going to be a political price to pay for it, because it will demoralize her base heading into 2018 and, honestly, it may even jeopardize 2020,” said Zaheed. 
Ben Wikler, Washington director at MoveOn.org, predicted that the Democratic party is potentially moving “from an electoral storm into a governance storm.” 
Clinton, Wikler told The Hill , “will find ‘tremendous grassroots support if she goes to the mat’ for her liberal campaign platform. And if she doesn’t, those same grassroots liberals are ‘emboldened and empowered’ and ‘ready to hold her to account.’” 
And Clinton seems to be aware of this dynamic. 
Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee (PCCC), points to the fact that the Clinton campaign has Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as well as her former primary rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) aggressively campaigning on her behalf the last full week before the election, with stops in a number of pivotal battleground states. 
And while both are doing all they can to ensure that her presidential rival, Republican nominee Donald Trump, is not elected, Green is hopeful that the two progressive firebrands will provide “‘a pre-emptive chilling effect on bad behavior’ if she does win the presidency,” The Hill reports. 
Indeed, Sanders has said that he intends to “leverage” the popularity he gained during the primary to ensure that Clinton enacts the party agenda and does not nominate the “same old, same old Wall Street guys” for regulatory positions. 
And emails from Clinton’s campaign chair John Podesta recently leaked by WikiLeaks illustrated how she sought Warren’s approval and support. In one instance, her staff expressed concern that the by opposing a new Glass-Steagall Act, Clinton would appear too pro-Wall Street and thus “antagonize and activate Elizabeth Warren.” 
Progressive leaders, including Sanders and 350.org co-founder Bill McKibben , have vowed that there will no honeymoon period for the centrist Democrat, should she be elected—and campaigners say that Clinton would be wise to heed their advice and go for those “big, bold ideas,” like tuition-free college, a higher minimum wage, a just transition to renewable energy, and Medicare for all. 
As Green told The Hill , Clinton’s success will be largely determined by two factors: How aggressively she pushes the progressive party platform in the first 100 days of her presidency and how effectively she rallies public support for those policies. “The absolute best way to get something done is to push big, bold ideas, get the public on your side and force Republicans to the table,” Green said. If she adopts that strategy, “the Republicans will cave,” Green said. “It’s just that simple.”

11520,H-1B Experts on Trump’s Order: ‘This Is What We Elected Him For’,"President Donald Trump is getting praise from experts on the   foreign guest worker visa for his ‘Hire American’ Executive Order which calls for a review into the system’s abuse at the expense of American workers. [Although the   visa is only meant to be used by a U. S. company when there are no American workers with the   needed for the job, critics argue the program is riddled with abuse and fraud, leaving Americans to sometimes train their cheaper, foreign replacements before being fired.  Trump’s new executive order targeting abuse by U. S. companies, as Breitbart News reported, calls for the Department of Justice (DOJ) the Labor Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct a “full legal analysis” of all the problems negatively impacting American workers in the   visa system.   expert and attorney John Miano told Breitbart Texas that Trump’s move on the issue is one that is setting the administration on the right trajectory. “We’re going to want to see some   later on,” Miano said in an interview. “But you can’t criticize the president for taking action. This is what we elected him for. ” Miano said the fact that Trump is mentioning the   visa program, an issue that went unaddressed by at least the past two administrations, is “very big. ” Likewise, Sara Blackwell, an attorney who represents Americans who’ve been fired because programs like the   applauded Trump’s move. “We hope it’s a beginning of a lot more. I’m hopeful,” Blackwell told Breitbart Texas. “But, I’m extremely happy that President Trump is talking about it and acknowledging there’s a huge problem. ” The legal review by DOJ, the DOL and DHS will include tracking down abuses within the   visa program where more than 85, 000 Americans are either replaced or passed over for jobs by foreign nationals. Experts like NumberUSA’s Rosemary Jenks and the Center for Immigration Studies’ Mark Krikorian both said the   legal review approach by the Trump Administration is the right way to go about ending the mass discrimination against American workers that currently takes place. “I do think it’s the right approach to take because [DOJ, Labor Dept. and DHS] have different roles to play,” Jenks told Breitbart Texas. “Abuse is handled by the Labor Department. DHS is the agency that’s setting requirements for admission. And DOJ is prosecuting the abusers. This is definitely the right approach. I hope the administration will continue talking to outside groups. ” “Clearly, by indicating that all three departments have to do a review of the program, the White House is making clear they understand the process,” Krikorian told Breitbart Texas. “The initial clearinghouse is the Department of Labor. A lot of the cheap labor aspects can be addressed by the Labor Department’s regulations and statutes. ” Krikorian said he was glad to see the Trump Administration calling for a broad review into the   visa system, rather than taking smaller, administrative actions. “At the same time, it’s encouraging that they didn’t just try to change   unilaterally, they understand there’s a lot of moving parts to it,” Krikorian said. “They know a lot of this has to be fixed by Congress. ” Before the Executive Order, the Trump administration worried critics of the   visa after not making any changes to the system before the application process began. For instance, the Trump Administration could have changed the   system from its current state of handing out visas through a random lottery, switching it to a process where the   jobs are given priority. Krikorian, though, told Breitbart Texas that the lack of prior change to   was mostly likely not politically driven, but rather the administration simply running out of time on the issue. Nonetheless, the new executive order has changed the outlook Americans impacted by the   have on the Trump administration, Blackwell said. “Well the people who are affected by this and know this businesses model were extremely deflated when the   application process started without changes,” Blackwell said. “Now, they’ve gone from hopeless to hopeful. ” Last week, Breitbart Texas exclusively reported how Trump Senior Adviser Stephen Miller held a White House meeting on the   visa issue with longtime critics like Blackwell and Howard University professor Ron Hira.

44342,Trump's shifting positions since U.S. election win,"(Reuters) - After firing up crowds with boisterous and sometimes divisive campaign rhetoric, Donald Trump has appeared to moderate some stances since he won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8. Such shifts have cheered critics concerned about his campaign positions while angering some supporters. But Trump  also sometimes modified positions during the campaign, so the Republican president-elect could change stances again before or after he takes office on Jan. 20. The following are some of his changing positions: To chants from crowds of “Lock her up,” Trump said during the campaign that if he won the election, his administration would prosecute his Democratic rival over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, and over what he said were abuses of her position with regard to her family’s charitable foundation. During the second presidential debate on Oct. 9, he said he would appoint a special prosecutor and seek to jail Clinton if he won. Asked during a New York Times interview on Nov. 22 about reports that he no longer wanted to prosecute Clinton, Trump said, “I want to move forward, I don’t want to move back. And I don’t want to hurt the Clintons. I really don’t.” However, he said “no” when asked if he was definitively taking the idea of investigating Clinton off the table.  Trump has called global warming a hoax and during the campaign he said he wanted to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Agreement among almost 200 nations, which came into effect on Nov. 4. Instead, he said he would push ahead and develop cheap coal, shale and oil. On Nov. 12, a source on his transition team said Trump’s advisers were considering ways to bypass a theoretical four-year procedure for leaving the climate accord. Asked in the Times interview on Nov. 22 if he was going to take America out of the world’s lead of confronting climate change, Trump said, “I have an open mind to it. We’re going to look very carefully.” Asked if he believed human activity causes climate change, he said, “I think there is some connectivity. There is some, something. It depends on how much.” During the campaign, Trump said he would repeal President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act. He called Obamacare a “disaster” and said he would replace it with a plan that would give states more control over the Medicaid health plan for the poor and allow insurers to sell plans nationally. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Nov. 11, Trump said he was considering keeping parts of the law, including provisions letting parents keep adult children up to age 26 on insurance policies and barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. “Either Obamacare will be amended, or repealed and replaced,” Trump told the Journal. On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to curb illegal immigration and that Mexico would pay for it. He also said he would deport millions of illegal immigrants and proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country as a means of countering terrorism. He never retracted this but in the later stages of the campaign, rephrased it as a proposal to temporarily suspend immigration from regions deemed as exporting terrorism and where safe vetting cannot be ensured. In an interview with CBS program “60 Minutes” that aired on Nov. 13, Trump said he really planned to build a wall. However, asked if this could be a fence, he said it could be part wall, part fence. “For certain areas I would (have a fence) but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I’m very good at this - it’s called construction,” he said. Asked about deporting illegal immigrants, he told CBS that the initial focus would be on those immigrants who are “criminal and have criminal records,” who he said probably numbered 2 million and possibly even 3 million. During the campaign, Trump said the United States should revive use of waterboarding and “a lot more” when questioning terrorism suspects. Waterboarding, an interrogation tactic that simulates drowning, is widely regarded as torture and was banned under President Barack Obama. In the Nov. 22 Times interview, Trump said he had been impressed when he asked Marine General James Mattis, a potential pick for defense secretary, about waterboarding and Mattis replied, “I’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.” While the response had not made him change his mind, Trump said, it had impressed him that the use of waterboarding was “not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think.” ",0
27778, The Stupid Is Spreading: Now Darrell Issa Doesn’t Think President Obama Is Black (VIDEO),"When you think of who might be the perfect person to talk about who is black and who isn t, Darrell Issa probably isn t the first to come to mind. He s likely not the second or third or even 1,453rd either. However, the Congressman from California thought it wise to weigh in on Ben Carson s comments regarding President Obama.On an earlier Politico podcast, Carson had said that Obama was  raised white  and can t relate to black Americans: He s an  African  American. He was, you know, raised white  I mean, like most Americans, I was proud that we broke the color barrier when he was elected, but   he didn t grow up like I grew up   Many of his formative years were spent in Indonesia. So, for him to, you know, claim that, you know, he identifies with the experience of black Americans, I think, is a bit of a stretch. So, when CNN s Chris Cuomo brought up these remarks to Issa and asked if this was the sort of rhetoric the GOP should get behind, the Congressman had the audacity to say that Carson is  a wonderful human being and he was technically correct in what he said. Issa did insinuate that this is the sort of thing better said by a private citizen and not if you re seriously considering running for the highest office in the land, also saying that Carson isn t ready to be president. However, the fact that Issa would have the gall to agree with Carson s sentiment is absolutely appalling, yet somehow not at all surprising. Video/Featured image via Raw Story YouTube",1
27625, President Obama Just Put Republicans In Their Place With 36 Words From The Constitution (IMAGE),"Ever since Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s death. Republicans have been clear about one thing: No matter what, they intend to obstruct Obama because every day is a day that ends in  -day.  While the president has a Constitutional duty to appoint a new Justice to replace the much-reviled racist, anti-gay, anti-woman sleazebag now that he is burning in Hell, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed that he won t allow the Senate to even consider Obama s nominee   no hearings, no votes, nothing.Republicans falsely claim that it is outside  tradition  for a president to appoint a new Supreme Court Justice in his final year in office, despite that a full third of presidents have done so in an election year. On Tuesday, the president met with McConnell and  Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley in the Oval Office to talk about Obama s plan to nominate someone within the next couple weeks. Unfortunately, the Republicans refused to budge on their mission to obstruct the president.The meeting barely lasted forty minute and, while the president offered to consider anyone McConnell and pals suggested for the position, they continued their usual modus operandi of not having a single f*cking idea.After the pointless meeting, President Obama took to social media to smack down some elephants. On Facebook, he brilliantly trolled the  pro-Constitution  party with 36 words that should (but won t) shut them up   namely, Article II Section 2 of the Constitution. The message was punctuated with the hashtag #DoYourJob   a message Obama has been sending Republicans since they initially announced that they would obstruct him no matter what. On Twitter, the president posted a petition urging the Senate to do its job. Our Supreme Court is too important to be held hostage by the same partisan gridlock that has caused government shutdowns,  the petition reads.  President Obama is taking his constitutional responsibility seriously the Senate should do the same.  Along with the petition, Obama left a very clear message: Leaving a seat open on the Supreme Court for more than a year is irresponsible. Along with the petition, Obama left a very clear message: Leaving a seat open on the Supreme Court for more than a year is irresponsible    but what else can we expect from Republicans these days? Irresponsibility is their defining attribute. Do your job  is not a hard message to understand, but it is certainly not a course of action the Party of Reagan views as viable.Featured image via White House/screengrab",1
96,Poll: Most Voters Have Not Heard of Democratic 2020 Election Candidates - Breitbart,"There is a minefield of potential 2020 election candidates in the Democratic Party waiting to challenge President Trump, but most voters have not heard of many of them, according to a new poll. [The   Consult poll asked 1, 990 registered voters their views on 19 potential Democratic challengers to Trump’s presidency.  The list of potential candidates identified in the survey includes eight senators, five governors, a mayor of a large city, a congressman, two CEOs, a former vice president, and a failed Senate candidate. Of those mentioned in the survey, half of the respondents did not know most of the candidates. “All bets are off when it comes to the composition of the 2020 Democratic primary,” said Morning Consult   and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. “This early polling indicates that many of the names being floated in Washington still have a lot of work to do in terms of building national profiles. ” Most survey respondents were able to identify and have opinions on former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ( ) and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ).   of the voters surveyed said they knew enough about Biden and Warren to have formed opinions about the candidates. Sanders was not included in the survey. According to Morning Consult, Biden was the most popular candidate of the list of potential 2020 Democratic candidates, with 74 percent of respondents having a positive view of the former vice president. Warren came in second, with 51 percent of respondents viewing her favorably. The number of those rumored to be potential Democratic candidates for the 2020 election pales in comparison to the list of people who have filed to run for president so   129 people have filed to run for the presidency in 2020.",0
24000, Trump Stooge: Women Making Assault Claims Are Too UGLY To Be Believed (VIDEO),"One of Donald Trump s top campaign officials has once again made a gross sexist comment while defending the nominee. Appearing on CNN to discuss the large group of women who have accused Trump of unwanted sexual advances and misconduct, Trump attorney Michael Cohen told the host that the women in question  aren t even women he d be attracted to. It was disgusting.Michael Cohen says Trump was saying accusers are ""not someone he would be attracted to"" so that makes the claims ""nonsense"" pic.twitter.com/2Kn2sUuPDe  Colin Jones (@colinjones) October 18, 2016 Beauty is in the eye of beholder   these aren t even women he d be attracted to,  Cohen said of Trump in a CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday.That line follows a recurring argument Trump has been making on the campaign trail   that some of the women who accused him of groping, kissing, and manhandling them were not attractive and therefore are not telling the truth.Cohen went on to say,  I think what Mr. Trump is really trying to say is that they re not somebody that he would be attracted to, and therefore, the whole thing is nonsense. The ongoing controversy over Trump s behavior and comments have helped to damage his already failing campaign. Every serious national poll now shows Trump behind from anywhere from 4% to 12%.Nobody has ever returned from a deficit that large in the history of presidential polling, and the same average that shows Clinton now well ahead correctly foresaw the winner of the last four presidential elections.Women have been key to Trump s collapse. While a slight majority of men back Trump, Clinton s advantage with women has consistently been 11% and higher, even before the latest round of revelations.In addition to rejecting his current behavior, women responding to the pollsters have said that his dismissive attitude towards them has contributed to Clinton s support.The poll drop also comes as Trump spent days attacking former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, in what was seen as a continuation of his fat-shaming of her in the 1990s.Featured image via screen capture",1
19206,"Welcome Back to a Bipolar World, Courtesy of a Moscow-Beijing-Tehran Axis - Federico Pieraccini","Welcome Back to a Bipolar World, Courtesy of a Moscow-Beijing-Tehran Axis 
America's 'unipolar moment' is over, but the long-awaited 'multipolar world' isn't quite yet here either Originally appeared at Strategic Culture Foundation 

The transition in the international order, from a pre-WWI multipolar world to a post-WWII bipolar world, cost humanity a world war involving millions of deaths. The next stage, distinct from the conflicts between the USSR and the US, ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, but without the tragedy of direct confrontation. This fundamental historical difference has its own intrinsic logic governing the relationship of forces between powers. The USSR was a country in decline, unable to continue its role on the international stage as the premier anti-hegemonic power. 
The transition from a bipolar to a unipolar reality could have had nuclear consequences, but an agreement between the powers avoided this danger. The upshot was an unconditional surrender of the USSR, with catastrophic consequences in economic and cultural terms for the superpower to come to terms with, but at least without the explosion of a large-scale conflict. 
With the end of the bipolar model, however, began what some historians declared to be the « end of history »: the transition from a multipolar world, to a bipolar world, to end in a unipolar world. From the point of view of Washington, the story ended with only one global power remaining, thereby granting the United States the power to decide matters for the whole world. 
The scenario in which we live today, in terms of international law and the balance of forces, is almost unprecedented in history if looked at in the present context. It is true that the current transition from a unipolar to a multipolar reality is something similar to what has been seen in previous decades, with the transition from British hegemony in the late-nineteenth century to a multipolar situation in the period preceding the two world wars. Nevertheless, resorting to this historical analogy is difficult, given the relative absence of international rules compared to a century ago. Therefore it is difficult to use the earlier transition period to make assumptions about future trends. 
The causes of change 
The attitude of the US over the last 25 years has been focused completely on the achievement of global hegemony. The dream of having control over every event, in every corner of the world, has ironically led to accelerating the end of America’s unipolar moment. Of course the deep meaning of the word ""control"" can be expanded upon, examining the merits of the cultural, economic and military impositions that result from a constant quest for global domination . 
The US has chosen an impassable road that is full of contradictions to justify their rise as a global power. In two decades we have witnessed the dismantling of all the key principles of the balance of power between Russia and the United States, necessitating the change in international relations from unipolar to multipolar. Similarly, the ratio of economic and military power between China and the United States has significantly worsened, culminating in the dangerous dispute over the South China Sea. The abandonment of the Kissinger doctrine governing relations with Beijing, and the failure of the Clinton reset with Moscow, have pushed two global powers, Russia and China, to forge an alliance that allows for a world where there are more powers on the international stage and not just Washington as the central focus of global relations. 
The failure of the foreign doctrine of the United States was a direct consequence of the arrogance and the utopia of being able to dominate the planet, seeking to extend indefinitely the unipolar moment and forging a worldwide system culturally and economically based on the will of Washington, reinforced by a power and military posture without precedent. 
Consequences 
Had Washington thought more carefully about the consequences of their actions, and thereby employed a more considered strategic vision, it would certainly have opted for different choices. As a demonstration of this, we note Washington’s attitude in the Middle East, the deciding ground for prospects of continued US global hegemony. 
Much of Washington’s remaining capacity to influence global decisions is attributable to the dollar and the trading of goods such as oil in that currency. With the appearance of a world with more regional or global powers, it is easy to guess that the rise of the Iranian Republic has consequences for the whole of the Middle East region. The odds are evident that Tehran, culturally, economically and militarily, will be the first regional power. Washington has realized this and has decided to reach an agreement with the Islamic Republic in order to remain relevant in the region and not to be cut off from future agreements. Washington also seeks, in doing so, to counterbalance the situation with her most influential regional allies, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. 
It is a strategy that in the Middle East has had a negative impact in the immediate present for Riyadh, Doha, and in some ways even Ankara, who have all opted for an autonomous and interventionist approach in the region without much consultation with Washington. Nevertheless, the choice to include Iran as a dialogue partner for the Middle East balance has allowed Washington to conserve the illusion that in the future it will maintain an important role in regional decisions. This is a decision that has created many problems with historic allies, but Washington hopes, with a view to the future, to have made an appropriate choice. This also explains why so many of the neoconservatives and liberals (the promoters of a prolonged unipolar doctrine, the cause of so many failures ) are clearly opposed to this agreement. 
Washington and its establishment have opted for a cultural and economic confrontation with Moscow, possibly militarily with Beijing in the South China Sea, in the process impelling the emergence of a multipolar world in which more powers have the ability, by joining together, to resist the will of the greater global power. In fact, it is easier to frame the international balance in a multipolar model that is slowly becoming bipolar. 
We consider that Russia and China (and to a lesser extent Iran) do not possess the military capability to successfully oppose American power in a conventional conflict on a grand scale. For this reason, it is easy to understand that shaping a multipolar international order perhaps remains quite optimistic at this time. It is similarly optimistic to maintain a unipolar world order that remains anchored in the illusions of the American elite. 
Reality rather shows us a bipolar world, where the alternative pole to the US is represented by the union and alliances (cultural, economic and military) of Beijing, Moscow and Tehran. And their partnership has resulted in a change in the pattern of international relations. The cause of this union is to be found in the will of the US elites to prolong their unipolar moment. Instead of opting for an agreement with another global power (probably China) and seal the international stage in a realistic model with two poles, facing no real opposition, Washington has exacerbated the differences by pushing countries like Russia, China, Iran and India closer and closer together, forging what currently might be termed a temporary bipolar model of world order. 
The certainty is that the future will turn fully into a multipolar model, and this obliges Washington to struggle in every way possible to remain relevant. To date, apart from nuclear agreements, every choice has been counterproductive and wrong. Will Washington’s elites ever learn, or will they eventually become irrelevant?  ",1
22454, WATCH: Trump Education Minion Betsy DeVos Runs Away After Being Blocked From Entering Public School,"Donald Trump s Education Secretary found out how hated she is on Friday.Betsy DeVos bought her way onto Trump s Cabinet earlier this month after a long confirmation battle. DeVos nearly lost in the Senate and it took a tie-breaking vote from Mike Pence to secure her confirmation. Of course, DeVos is only in her position today because she gave millions of dollars to sitting Republican senators.Her nomination was hotly contested because she wants to destroy the public education system in favor of religious schools. It also didn t help that she supports an organization that thinks children should be able to work in mines and thinks guns belong in schools to defend against bears.Seriously.Anyway, when DeVos attempted to visit a pubic school in Washington DC on Friday she was met by protesters who refused to let her in the door. The shamed her and ordered her to leave. She does not represent anything that they stand for!  one protester said. Keep giving money to Senate and buying your way into the position,  said another.  You should be so proud of yourself! Rather than keep trying, DeVos ran away, got in a vehicle and drove off as protesters continued yelling their disapproval.Here s the video via Twitter.WATCH: Sec. Betsy DeVos physically blocked by protesters from entering DC school turned away and left. Video: @SweeneyABC pic.twitter.com/RAycuKEVgm  ABC 7 News   WJLA (@ABC7News) February 10, 2017According to Huffington Post,Sitting Republican senators have received $115,000 from Betsy DeVos herself, and more than $950,000 from the full DeVos clan since 1980. In the past two election cycles alone, her family has donated $8.3 million to Republican Party super PACs.Furthermore, DeVos had openly admitted that she and her family have spent millions of dollars to buy influence and said she expects something in return. I have decided to stop taking offense at the suggestion that we are buying influence,  she once wrote.  Now I simply concede the point. They are right. We do expect something in return. And that is why she is now Secretary of Education and why millions of parents across the country are pissed off. They should not only block her from entering schools, they should block her from entering the Education Department.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",1

53576,Taiwan president calls for breakthrough in China relations,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan and China need to drop historical baggage to seek a breakthrough in relations, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in her first public comments since China s ruling Communist Party unveiled a new leadership line-up. Relations nose-dived after Tsai, who leads the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, took office last year, with China suspecting that she wants to push for the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Beijing has suspended a regular dialogue mechanism with Taipei established under Taiwan s previous, China-friendly government, and there has been a dramatic fall in the number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan under Tsai s administration.  Right now is a turning point for change. I once again call on leaders of both sides to ... seek a breakthrough in cross-straits relations and to benefit the long-term welfare of people on both sides and to forever eliminate hostilities and conflict,  Tsai told a forum.  While acknowledging the changes in China s leadership announced on Wednesday, Tsai did not comment specifically on the composition of Xi s core team. But she reiterated that while the island s goodwill towards China would not change, Taipei would not submit to pressure. Responding to Tsai s speech, China s Taiwan Affairs Office said the political basis for relations across the Taiwan Strait was the  one China  principle, which states that the mainland and Taiwan are part of one China. As long as that is recognized, there are no obstacles to any talks between the sides, the office said in a statement carried by state media. China has been stepping up the pressure on Taiwan. This year, China s air force has carried out several rounds of drills near Taiwan, prompting the island s air force to scramble fighters. Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said Taiwan was a part of China and the military exercises would continue as normal, adding that China was sincere in seeking  peaceful reunification .  At the same time, we have the ability, confidence and means to protect the country s unity, sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,  he told a monthly news conference in Beijing later in the day. Chinese President Xi Jinping drew strong applause at last week s start of the Communist Party Congress when he said any attempt to separate Taiwan from China would be thwarted.  Taipei s Mainland Affairs Council delivered a swift response, saying it was  absolutely  the right of Taiwan s 23 million people to decide their future. China regards self-ruled and democratic Taiwan as a wayward province, to be brought under Beijing s rule by force if necessary. ",0
10255,Pollak: The Attack on Trump Is Exactly What a Russian Disinformation Campaign Looks Like - Breitbart,"The accusation that President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign colluded with the Russians, and that he is trying to cover it up, looks increasingly like a classic Russian disinformation campaign  —   one designed to bring down the only president since the Cold War who has actually been willing to confront Russia in any meaningful way. [It is an article of faith on the left that Russia wanted Trump to win the election because Vladimir Putin anticipated a more pliant approach, signaled by Trump’s explicit desire to negotiate a better relationship. But the Russians may just as well have preferred Hillary Clinton, who had given Russia everything it wanted while serving as President Barack Obama’s Secretary of State  —   from the   “reset,” to a surrender of U. S. missile defenses in Eastern Europe, to the sale of 20% of America’s uranium reserves to a Russian company closely tied to the Russian state.  It is more plausible to suggest that Russia simply wants to disrupt American politics if it can get away with doing so, and would do the same regardless of which candidate won the election. Even if  —   for argument’s sake  —   Putin once preferred Trump, that would not preclude him from trying to undermine President Trump now, if possible. And in the “ ” complex, Putin has found a particularly potent weapon, aimed directly at the president. One could not imagine a better way to create havoc for an adversary  —   and the left is playing into the enemy’s hands, eagerly and mindlessly, forgetting its own slavish enthusiasm for Russia for nearly a century. Holman Jenkins, writing in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday, notes that Putin found a unique vulnerability in the   of contemporary American politics, which makes devotees on either side more willing to believe the worst about the other. Partisans on both sides might share a conspiratorial mindset when relegated to opposition status, but only the Democrats can harness the alchemy of the mainstream media to “normalize” fringe theories. Regardless, the flimsiness of the evidence against Trump is a clue. Jenkins notes that it was a dubious “dossier” that alleged that Russia had dirt on Trump that caused much of the initial suspicion last year  —   and that it may well have been fed by Russian sources for that purpose. Add to that the recent revelation that FBI director James Comey suspected that a key email  —   purportedly hacked by Russians, and which implicated Attorney General Loretta Lynch in a scheme to suppress any FBI investigation into Clinton  —   was a fake, and a pattern seems to emerge. Moreover, many of the recent intelligence leaks that have attempted to tie Trump to Putin have been   at best  —   in some cases, laughably so. The information that has been leaked could well have been fabricated  —   or at least fed to unwitting U. S. Intelligence sources who were ready to believe, and convey, the worst. Sen. Lindsey Graham  —   an early critic of Trump’s Russia policy  —   said as much on Sunday, when he speculated that an intercepted message from the Russian ambassador to his bosses back home, claiming that Jared Kushner wanted to set up a “back channel,” could well have been a   exposed on purpose to be intercepted by the U. S. Regardless, Trump is almost certainly right that the Russians are “laughing” at us. The entire political and media establishment is utterly consumed by an obsession with Russian influence for which there is no actual evidence. It is a hysteria worse than that of the McCarthy years, because in those days there really were American communists trying to take over the U. S. government on Moscow’s behalf. Thanks to the “  complex,” this may be the most powerful Russian disinformation campaign ever, and stands on the verge of bringing the American Republic to its knees. Journalists and elected Democrats are busily slapping each other on the back for “standing up for democracy. ” To the extent that they believe it  —   when they are doing the opposite  —   Russia is surely grateful.

55200,Danish divers find missing body parts of Swedish journalist,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish police said on Saturday divers had found the head and the legs of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, who died in mysterious circumstances on an inventor s homemade submarine. Peter Madsen has been charged with killing the Swedish journalist who disappeared after she went on a trip with him in his submarine on August 10. He denies the charges. Madsen, a Dane, was arrested after his submarine sank and he was rescued. His lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told Reuters that she had been informed of the development, but had not received any material or documentation and decline further comment. Police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in Copenhagen later in August as Wall s, but a cause of death has not been determined. Madsen has said Wall died in an accident when she was hit by a heavy hatch cover on board his submarine. On Saturday a police spokesman told reporters in Copenhagen that there were no fractures to Wall s skull.  The body parts, a knife and some of Wall s clothes in bags weighted down by bits of metal were found in Koge Bay on Friday by Danish navy divers who are assisting the police. Police spokesman Jens Moller Jensen told reporters on Saturday that the body parts will be investigated further to try and determine a cause of death. He said that the Madsen and his lawyers had not had time yet to react to the new evidence. A police prosecutor said earlier this week that officers had found images  which we presume to be real  of women being strangled and decapitated on Peter Madsen s computer in a laboratory he ran. Madsen said the computer searched by police was not his but was used by everyone in the laboratory.   ",0
20544," Newsweek’s Latest Cover Effortlessly Demolishes ‘Lazy’ Trump, Meltdown Imminent (IMAGE)","The August 11, 2017 issue of Newsweek is one you might want to pick up. In fact, if you happen to own a golf course or two, you might even want to hang some copies up for decoration, because all that s missing from the cover is the golden club he got as a gift from the PM of Japan leaning against his easy chair.Accompanying the cover is a scathing op-ed from Brendan Smialowski that tears apart the legend Trump has tried to cultivate: He paints a picture of a successful presidency so far, with lots of accomplishments, admiration,  deals  with foreign leaders, and a jet-setting lifestyle befitting the king he surely thinks he is. Smialowski disagrees:The most impressive quality of Trump s myth is not just that it strays from reality but how thoroughly, even aggressively, it contravenes easily confirmable fact. When he was king, he was the King of Debt, and he may still owe as much as $1.8 billion to creditors. His casinos closed. His airline went bust. But even as he accrued failures, lawsuits and debts, Trump managed to turn  Trump  into a synonym for success.

15361,House G.O.P. Leaders Outline Plan to Replace Obama Health Care Act - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   House Republican leaders on Thursday presented their    members with the outlines of their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, leaning heavily on tax credits to finance individual insurance purchases and sharply reducing federal payments to the 31 states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and two House committee chairmen stood with the new secretary of health and human services, former Representative Tom Price of Georgia, preparing Republican lawmakers for a weeklong Presidents’ Day recess that promises to be dominated by angry or anxious questions about the fate of the health law. But the talking points they provided did not say how the legislation would be paid for, essentially laying out the benefits without the more controversial costs. It also included no estimates of the number of people who would gain or lose insurance under the plan, nor did it include comparisons with the Affordable Care Act, which has extended coverage to 20 million people. With the House proposal’s rollback of Medicaid payments to the states, it appears likely that the number covered would be smaller. House Republican leaders asserted in a document describing their plan that they would not “pull the rug out from anyone who received care under states’ Medicaid expansions. ” But Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, expressed alarm, saying the proposals would “put a huge amount of pressure on state budgets and put many Americans at risk of losing health care coverage. ” Sketchy as the outline was, it envisions major changes. It would fundamentally remake Medicaid, a Great Society program that provides health care to more than 70 million Americans, not just the poor, but also   people who have run out of money and need nursing home care. Under the plan, Medicaid, an   entitlement program designed to cover all health care needs, would be put on a budget. The Affordable Care Act’s subsidies, which expand as incomes decline, giving the poorer people more help, would be replaced by fixed tax credits to help people purchase insurance policies. The tax credits would increase with a person’s age, but would not vary with a person’s income. And new incentives for consumers to establish savings accounts to pay medical expenses still assume that workers would have money at the end of a pay period to sock away. The House Republican plan would also make it easier for consumers to buy health insurance from companies licensed in other states, an idea long promoted by Republicans in Congress and championed by President Trump in his campaign last year. After the recess, Mr. Ryan said: “We intend to introduce legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. It has become increasingly clear that this law is collapsing. People’s premiums are getting higher and higher. Their deductibles are soaring, and their choices are dwindling. ” Mr. Price told House Republicans that Mr. Trump “is all in on this. ” Mr. Ryan’s presentation on Thursday was meant to generate a sense of momentum for the Republicans’ campaign to eviscerate President Barack Obama’s health care law  —   a campaign that has been plagued by apprehensions, doubts and divisions among Republicans in the last few weeks. It was not clear whether the plan as outlined would get Republicans much closer to resolution. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate health committee, said that he and other Senate committee chairmen were working with their House counterparts, with the goal of developing a “consensus document. ” The House, he said, will probably act first but “will have the input of senators and the president. ” House conservatives are saying that any plan must begin with a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement that looks nothing like it. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the   Freedom Caucus, said Republicans needed to talk about replacement measures “in specific terms, not in aspirational terms. ” “We believe that it’s time that we make some very difficult decisions and move forward,” Mr. Meadows said. Any plan that can satisfy House conservatives would face great uncertainty in the more moderate Senate. The plan unveiled on Thursday by House Republican leaders would make huge changes in Medicaid. It would eventually undo the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid and give each state a fixed amount of money for each beneficiary. As an alternative, they said, a state could receive a lump sum of federal money for all of its Medicaid program, or a block grant. In either case, the federal government would gradually reduce the extra payments it makes to states that have expanded Medicaid under the 2010 health care law. States could continue providing Medicaid to the newly eligible beneficiaries, but the federal share of the costs would decline to the regular federal share of Medicaid costs for other beneficiaries. The federal government now pays more than 90 percent of the costs for newly eligible beneficiaries in states that expanded Medicaid. Under the House Republican plan, the federal share would decline to 50 percent in states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California, resulting in a significant loss of federal revenue. In a number of states that have expanded Medicaid, Republican governors and Republican members of Congress have made clear that they do not like the idea of a block grant or a   allotment. The Congressional Budget Office says that 12 million people have insurance because they became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and it estimates that federal spending for this group will be $70 billion this year. The House Republican plan would immediately eliminate tax penalties for people who do not have insurance and employers that do not offer it. It would also eliminate taxes and fees that help pay for the expansion of coverage under the 2010 health care law. These include fees collected from health insurance companies and manufacturers of   prescription drugs and an excise tax on makers of medical devices. House Republicans have repeatedly said that they would continue providing some protection for people with   medical conditions. But the document describing their proposal does not say how they would do that. Mr. Ryan said the tax credits envisioned by House Republicans were different from those provided in the Affordable Care Act. Under that law, the tax credits are available only for insurance products that meet detailed federal standards and are purchased through an insurance exchange like HealthCare. gov. By contrast, Mr. Ryan said, with the Republican version of tax credits, people can “buy the health insurance plan of their choosing,” which could cost less and have less generous coverage than the plans now available. “You get the freedom to do what you want and buy what you need,” Mr. Ryan said. During a transition period, House Republicans would continue “Obamacare subsidies,” but they would provide a little more assistance to young people and a little less to older Americans. The House Republican plan would provide an unspecified amount of money for “innovation grants,” which states could use to help defray consumers’    costs or to establish “  pools” for people with serious chronic conditions.",0
13484,Russian couple’s firm making the world a little cleaner and greener - Russia News Now,"This post was originally published on this site 
Evgeny Demin and Elena Demina moved from the Krasnodar Territory in southern Russia to Moscow with a small idea and big ambitions. In 2000, when they were not yet 25 years old, they founded SPLAT, a company that today supplies personal care and household chemical products to 45 countries around the world. 
“In the beginning, the company specialized in the production of biologically active additives and cosmetics based on Spirulina platensis seaweed — thus the company name,” explains Evgeny Demin. 
They quickly decided to target their efforts in another direction: on the production of next-generation toothpaste. 
“From the very start, we agreed to create the best toothpaste in the world, so that it would surpass all expectations,” he said.

The couple first rented a factory for their operations near Moscow and in 2009 they opened their own plant 300 miles northwest of the Russian capital in the Novgorod Region. Today it employs more than 350 people. A total of 700 people work for the company, including in sales and marketing offices abroad. 
The company has opened a subsidiary and hired a local team in China and is now looking forward to working with its Chinese partners, according to SPLAT’s press service. The company’s premium products are particularly popular in Germany and SPLAT has also started to sell its products in France. The company currently owns more than 10 Russian and foreign patents. The right segment 
From the very beginning SPLAT toothpaste was priced about twice that of its supermarket rivals. Entering the premium segment, where there were practically no competitors, was one of the factors of the brand’s success, says Alexander Yeremenko, managing director of the BrandLab marketing agency. 
According to Yeremenko when SPLAT debuted, two major international players, Procter&Gamble and Colgate, had claimed the middle segment of the Russian market, while the lower end was dominated by Russian producers selling very cheap toothpaste. 
“In the high-price segment, besides LACALUT, there were no important players,” Yeremenko said. 
Source: Press photo 
Some of SPLAT’s exclusive offerings include black toothpaste made from Karelian coal and golden toothpaste featuring extracts of diamond and colloidal gold. SPLAT’s scientific laboratory and R&D center in Moscow are in charge of developing the toothpaste’s unique components. 
In 2008 the company began exporting its products and by 2015 foreign sales made up 17 percent of its revenue. One of its most successful foreign markets is Turkey, where SPLAT was able to sign an exclusive contract with one of the country’s leading perfume and cosmetics chains. 
The company has opened a subsidiary and hired a local team in China and is now looking forward to working with its Chinese partners, according to SPLAT’s press service. The company’s premium products are particularly popular in Germany and SPLAT has also started to sell its products in France. The company currently owns more than 10 Russian and foreign patents.

The company has not divulged any financial indicators, but in value terms SPLAT holds 9.7 percent of the Russian market and in terms of sales it has a 14.7-percent market share, says Timur Nigmatullin, an analyst at Finam Holding. 
Nigmatullin attributes SPLAT’s success in part to its unusual marketing strategy. The company does not employ TV advertising on principle and focuses its energies on repeat sales to loyal customers. 
Yeremenko believes that SPLAT’s marketing efforts were appropriate for a product in the high-end segment of the market where consumers value innovation and are ready to pay for it. 
“SPLAT did not have money for promotion, which is why all efforts were directed at achieving a high-quality and innovative product,” Yeremenko said, adding that the firm’s unique offerings, such as being the first black toothpaste or having unusual taste and components are all elements of marketing, which requires constant research and experimentation. 
The company also takes a personal approach to encouraging brand loyalty. Each SPLAT toothpaste package contains a letter from Evgeny Demin himself, the firm’s general director. At the end of each letter, he provides his personal email address noting that he responds to all messages himself. 
“The director’s letters in the packages create the impression of the producer’s responsibility to the customer; [they] guarantee a quality approach and the company’s excellent result on the market,” Yeremenko said. Not just toothpaste 
Today SPLAT has diversified and it produces more than 200 different products from its 50,000 sq. ft. plant in the Novgorod Region. The company’s offerings include toothpastes, brushes, foams and mouthwashes, the BioMio ecological line of housekeeping products, the organic LALLUM Baby line of natural cosmetics for children and mothers and the HEYA series of natural shampoos and conditioners.

HEYA is one of SPLAT’s latest developments and is one of co-founder Elena Demina’s proudest accomplishments. 
“The idea of creating products for health and hair beauty that would be just as unique and effective as all the other SPLAT products, came to us a long time ago,” she said. “Our team spent more than five years working on it.” 
The market for hair care products is highly competitive, but SPLAT’s offerings, made exclusively from natural ingredients without silicon or parabens, are unique. The company took its time developing the HEYA series components, but Demina says she is very happy with the result. 
“We do not compete with other hair care producers because, all modesty aside, we believe that our products are unique and unrepeatable,” she said.

Nigmatullin considers the Russian market robust and large enough to accommodate new products, despite the unfavorable economic situation and the difficult investment climate. 
“The SPLAT phenomenon is not the only one,” Nigmatullin said. “There are many other examples: UAZ, Ural motorcycles, a long list of medicine produced in local plants, confectionery and so on.” 
According to Yeremenko SPLAT’s success can be attributed to hard work and planning. 
“Actually, SPLAT’s story is not as magical as it seems,” Yeremenko said. “It is proof of a solid marketing approach, which basically any producer can adopt.” 
In his view, SPLAT’s founders demonstrated sound judgment and perseverance in developing their idea. 
“The problem with most Russian companies is not the lack of ideas, but that they don’t know where they’re going,” he said. “But SPLAT had a strategy and most importantly, it patiently implemented it.” Subscribe to get the hand picked best stories every week Related ",1

We will put the final withdrawal agreement between the UK and the EU to a vote in both houses of parliament before it comes into force,  May told parliament.  We expect the UK parliament to vote ahead of the European parliament so we fully expect parliament to vote well before March 2019,  she added.  Of course after we leave, the withdrawal agreement will be followed up by one or more agreements covering different aspects of the future relationship and we will introduce further legislation where it is needed to implement this into UK law, providing yet another opportunity for proper parliamentary scrutiny.

49405,Mexico presidential front-runner unveils planned cabinet,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The leftist front-runner for Mexico s 2018 presidential election on Thursday proposed a moderate U.S.-trained economist for finance minister, unveiling a planned cabinet made up of men and women in equal measure. Former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had a 12-point lead in one recent poll. He wants to overhaul Mexico s approach to the economy, security and education, vowing more support for the poorest but without new taxes or higher debt. For the finance portfolio, Lopez Obrador tapped Carlos Manuel Urzua, an academic who served as finance minister of the Mexico City government from 2000 to 2003 when the candidate, 64, was mayor of the capital. A veteran campaigner, Lopez Obrador was runner-up in the last two presidential contests. A self-declared nationalist, he hopes Mexico will elect him next July, reversing a Latin American trend towards right-leaning governments. If he wins, it could increase friction with U.S. President Donald Trump over his anti-migrant language and policies. Lopez Obrador, or AMLO as he is often known, proposed a cabinet of eight men and eight women, including a onetime interior minister for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and a respected former supreme court judge. The naming of Urzua encouraged the view that AMLO would be a more pragmatic manager of Latin America s second biggest economy than critics have warned he would be.   We see an AMLO administration as increasingly moderate from a macroeconomic perspective and the signaling of Mr. Urzua, who is not an extremist economist by any means, corroborates this view,  Marcos Casarin, head of Latin America macro services Oxford Economics, said in emailed comments. An author, researcher and university professor, Urzua earned a PhD and Master in Economics from the University of Wisconsin and a degree in Mathematics from Mexico s Tecnologico de Monterrey. He is also a poet who writes about inequality. For interior minister, Lopez Obrador selected Olga Sanchez, a former Supreme Court justice who helped move the country s top tribunal in a more liberal direction during two decades in the job. For education, Lopez Obrador picked Esteban Moctezuma, who served as interior minister under former President Ernesto Zedillo. For energy, he named Rocio Nahle, a chemical engineer and lower house leader of his MORENA party. In the July 1 election, AMLO looks likely to face former finance minister Jose Antonio Meade for the PRI, and Ricardo Anaya at the head of a right-left opposition coalition. ",0
35809,INFINITE ARROGANCE: Obama Doesn’t Think The Supreme Court Should Have Taken Up Obamacare Challenge,"With an Imperial President who believes he is above the law, is there even a need for a Supreme court?On Monday, President Barack Obama said the Supreme Court should not have taken up the challenge to the Affordable Care Act in King v. Burwell. This should be an easy case. Frankly, it probably should not even have been taken up,  Obama said during a press conference at the G-7 summit in Germany.When asked whether the administration had a  plan B,  in the event that the Supreme Court strikes down subsidies in states that do not run their own health insurance exchanges, Obama said there are no easy solutions. You have a model where all the pieces connect,  he said.  And there are a whole bunch of scenarios   not just with relation to health care but all kinds of stuff I do   where if somebody does something that does not make any sense, it is hard to fix. This would be hard to fix. The president called the legal challenge  bizarre  in light of the law s successful implementation. What s more the thing s working,  Obama said.  Part of what is bizarre about the whole thing is that we have not had a lot of conversation about the horrors of Obamacare because none of them have come to pass. The Supreme Court will announce a ruling this month on whether the Affordable Care Act s designation of an  exchange established by the state  means that the law can only provide subsidies to individuals in states that run their own exchanges. If the court rules in favor of a narrow interpretation of that provision of the law, 6.4 million people in 34 states will lose their subsidies, leaving many unable to afford insurance.Via: Huffington Post",1
1235,Rory McIlroy: Is Abu Dhabi his next big championship?,"Rory McIlroy posted a level-par 72 in the final round at Dunhill Links
Rory McIlroy has chosen to hit the pause button rather than his driver for the next few weeks and it may prove the most important decision of his career.
It is most likely we will not see him again in competitive action until the Abu Dhabi Championship in January.
The 28-year-old's mediocre, winless 2017 season came to a self-determined and muted end at the Dunhill Links Championship on Sunday where he finished up sharing a miserable 63rd place.
It concluded a campaign where the Northern Irishman was eclipsed by a new generation of young talent. He knows it, too, and this is another reason for the break he is just starting.
For the rest of this year he will lay foundations for what he expects to be the second half of his career.
The initial objective is to get healthy enough to allow for prolonged range time. This is because, like the former world number one's body, his golf game has also been off colour for far too long.
In recent years, McIlroy has not made the most of his prodigious talents, having failed to add to the four majors he collected by the end of August 2014.
The following summer was ruined by a freak football injury immediately before his intended Open defence and since then there have been no further steps towards his stated ambition of 10 major titles.
McIlroy wants to overtake Gary Player's total of nine to become the game's most successful non-American golfer. But 2017 offered little evidence to suggest such a lofty ambition is attainable.
With his year seriously undermined by a rib problem, McIlroy managed to play in only 18 tournaments. There were seven top-10s in a campaign that included two runner-up finishes.
2014 Open Champion McIlroy ended on five under par at Royal Birkdale this year but was still seven shots behind winner Jordan Spieth
McIlroy's share of fourth place at The Open, where he was always playing catch-up after falling five over par after only six holes, was his best showing at the majors.
""I don't think any year is a wasted year,"" McIlroy told BBC Sport. ""I've learned a lot this year in terms of how I manage myself, manage my schedule and how I practise.
""It hasn't been what I've wanted in terms of results but it is not as though I have missed a ton of cuts.""
McIlroy is convinced the debilitating rib injury, which first surfaced while finishing second in last January's South African Open, is the prime reason for his lack of 2017 victories.
Now is the time to completely cure himself of its niggling effects. There will be long periods spent in the gym and doing rehabilitation work that will ultimately allow him to spend more time on the range.
""I will have six intensive weeks over November-December time where I will be getting my body right,"" McIlroy told me.
""But I think, as well, I will be mentally in a better place.
""It's been tough because physically I haven't been where I have needed to be and wanted to be this year.
""And that takes its toll mentally because you feel like you are trying to prepare and trying to practise but you just can't quite.
""I haven't felt 100% totally prepared any week that I've played because of the injury.""
It is clear that McIlroy is fed up with mediocrity, with being unable to capitalise on still possessing, arguably, the finest natural talents in the game.
There has been an air of resignation around the Northern Irishman. Blissfully happy off the course, the newlywed has lacked the same mojo inside the ropes.
Justin Thomas won the PGA Championship while fellow American Brooks Koepka secured the US Open title in 2017
And at the same time the competition has deepened. Americans Justin Thomas (24) and Brooks Koepka (27) are both younger than McIlroy and each became a major champion in 2017.
Jordan Spieth is only 24 and his Open win in July took the American to three majors, just one behind world number six McIlroy.
""The landscape of the game has changed a bit since I started to win majors,"" McIlroy told reporters at St Andrews.
""You've got young, hungry guys now who are fearless and they are playing the game how I basically came out and played a few years ago.
""It's just about trying to gain an advantage here or there, so just re-assessing everything and making sure I'm not leaving any stone unturned and do everything I can to get back to being the best player in the world.""
McIlroy feels he is a better player than the one who youthfully collected his initial major titles in 2011 and 2012. He spent 95 weeks of his first decade on tour as world number one.
""I see no reason why I can't better that in the next 10 years and that's why I feel like these three months are very important for me to put some really good things in place,"" he said.
McIlroy also has to decide on who will be the long-term caddie replacement for JP Fitzgerald, with whom he split after The Open in July.
He has to decide whether having his best friend, Harry Diamond, is the best option. Reports have suggested he may turn to Joe LaCava, the rather underworked caddie of Tiger Woods.
Harry Diamond, McIlroy's childhood best friend, first worked with the four-time major winner at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational
Certainly, someone alongside McIlroy with the course management skills to make the most of the player's substantial golfing gifts would seem a sensible move.
In the competitive landscape, he needs all the help he can get.
But McIlroy remains bullish about his chances. ""I'm still confident that I have the ability to do it,"" he said.
""The quality of golf out there now has not got any worse. It's only got better.
""But you know, I've been able to win tournaments against the best players in the world and playing at their best, and feel confident that I'll be able to do that again.""
What happens over the coming weeks may well determine the success of the second decade of his career.
One thing is for certain, McIlroy has had enough of trying to play catch-up. There is a career Grand Slam to complete - he only needs the Masters - a fifth Ryder Cup on the horizon and surging movement of golfing youth to be tamed.
With a confident smile, he told me: ""I actually feel like I'm getting a head-start on everyone else, which will be a nice position to be in.""",0

Newsflash   he really, really didn t.However, that didn t stop Trump from trying to pretend that he won, so not letting him get away with it was none other that John Oliver on HBO s Last Week Tonight.Oliver went through point by point explaining that random online polls are not representative of actual polling, but rather just the opinions of whoever or whatever decided to take the poll. He then used the hilarious example of how an online poll even ended up naming a boat the ever clever name of  Boaty McBoatface. Oliver also slammed Fox News  Sean Hannity for humoring Trump and also declaring him the winner of the debate with the use of the same random internet polls. Also bringing up the fact that Fox News itself had to issue a memo that those polls aren t scientific and are not to be used as fact, stating they  do not meet our editorial standards.

Kasich, 63, the Ohio governor and a former U.S. congressman, had vowed just a day earlier to keep running after U.S. Senator Ted Cruz dropped out following a poor showing in Indiana’s Republican primary on Tuesday. NBC cited an unidentified Kasich campaign source as saying the governor would suspend his campaign. The campaign did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. Kasich, who was able to win only his own state in the race for the 2016 Republican nomination, canceled a media appearance on Wednesday in Virginia and scheduled a 5 p.m. EDT statement in Columbus, Ohio, his campaign said.

24598, Hillary Completely Blew Away This Woman Who Receives Terrifying Hate From The Alt-Right,"When Ella Dawson started a blog discussing her trials with genital herpes, along with STI stigma, she expected prudes to come out of the woodwork and snipe at her for putting such a personal topic out for all to see. What she didn t expect was for the dangerous alt-right to find her and make her a target for their sick form of entertainment.When she decided to write about that, she likely also didn t expect to catch the attention of Hillary Clinton, let alone grab it enough to receive a personal letter back.The letter starts with: Thank you for the brave and insightful piece on Medium this week. I am so grateful for you for not only speaking out against the stigma surrounding sexually transmitted infections, but for also taking a courageous stand against the ridiculous, but very real, barrage of hate you have received online. She reiterated that love and kindness are among the central components of her campaign, and that the decline of civil public discourse is one of the more alarming problems in the digital age. Then she dropped this truth bomb: It s going to take all of us, working together, to restore our discourse and that work starts by calling out the bullies, chief among them Donald Trump and the alt-right. Read the whole letter below:Thank you, @HillaryClinton, for reading. I m incredibly moved. To be accurate, I m ugly crying. #ImWithHer pic.twitter.com/kt5tAVWrFX  Ella Dawson (@brosandprose) September 6, 2016The blog post that caught Hillary s attention discusses Dawson s very real and terrible problems with the alt-right. Her broader discussion, though, is about how rape threats, death threats, doxxing, shaming, and more, happen to women all over the Internet because we dare to Internet while female. The sheer gall of us to have an opinion and put it out there   we should, in the eyes of the misogynistic alt-right, stay silent. We bring the harassment on ourselves in their view.What s worse is that some of the people harassing Dawson aren t the typical cretins that inhabit the alt-right. Mike Cernovich, who s a lawyer, but more well-known for his sexist Internet presence, tweeted: Ugly and has herpes. Maybe an SJW male might actually be able to get at these table scraps. (Doubtful). Paul Joseph Watson, an editor-at-large at Alex Jones  InfoWars, recorded a five-minute YouTube video talking about how vile were the women who were tweeting under the hashtag #ShoutYourStatus for STD Awareness Month. He ended it with the typical sexist attack of: I don t think we should be that surprised that feminists are bragging about their STDs. After all, they re so fat and ugly, the mere fact that they re having any kind of sex at all is a massive achievement. Because the women the alt-right considers to be their eye candy all know their places and would never be so hateful towards men as to become a feminist. Sure.The response to that video caused Dawson to lock her Twitter account, lest Breitbart writers, and other misogynistic writers, embed her tweets in their stories, causing an ever-growing cycle of harassment. A man writing about this stuff would never receive this treatment. Ever.That s what Hillary knows, and has dealt with as a strong woman in a position of power for most of her life. Hillary stood up in Reno and read off Breitbart headlines while many other women are afraid to even mention that cesspool of a news site. Dawson has been a Hillary supporter for years, but her admiration for Hillary went through the roof when she witnessed this speech.Dawson ended her post with a thank-you to Hillary for having the guts (yes, it takes guts to stand up to the hate of the alt-right) to call the alt-right out for what it is. Misogyny, racism, white nationalism, white supremacy, anti-Semitism, and all-around hate are what the alt-right is about. That s despite the fact that, according to Dawson, they delusionally bill themselves as: [A] trendy new generation of conservatism, pushing boundaries and buttons in response to political correctness and liberal oversensitivity. Please. That is vile on its face.Bravo to Dawson for continuing to Internet while female, and bravo to Hillary for standing with her. That is what makes a president.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",1
3503,States Could Make Work a Medicaid Requirement Under G.O.P. Deal - The New York Times,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump and conservative lawmakers in the House agreed Friday to significant changes to Medicaid that could impose work requirements on   Medicaid beneficiaries in some states and limit federal funds for the program, as Republican leaders tried to rally balking lawmakers behind legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act. “I want everyone to know, I’m 100 percent behind this,” Mr. Trump said at the White House, where he met with House members in the conservative Republican Study Committee. At a news conference hours later, the president predicted, “It’s going to be passed, I believe  —   I think substantially and pretty quickly. ” On Capitol Hill, the outlook was far less clear. The House is tentatively scheduled to vote Thursday to repeal President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement, exactly seven years after Mr. Obama signed it into law. As some lawmakers came out for the measure, some others  —   in the House and Senate  —   were stepping forward to oppose it. “Fundamentally, I don’t believe this proposal provides an adequate   option for insurance access, nor does it address    costs,” Representative John Katko, Republican of New York, said in a statement on Friday. “Further, I am confident the proposal would harm hospitals across my district. ” The concessions to conservatives are significant  —   and politically risky. The Obama administration refused to allow work requirements, saying they were not consistent with the goals of Medicaid, the health program for   people. Several Republican governors have expressed interest in imposing such requirements on certain Medicaid beneficiaries  —     adults without minor children. “The Medicaid expansion has created a perverse incentive for states to provide benefits to   adults at the expense of the elderly, the blind and the disabled,” Representative Gary Palmer, Republican of Alabama, said this week. “A work requirement would help states focus their limited resources on the truly needy. ” The president and House conservatives also agreed to allow states to choose one   block grant to fund their Medicaid programs. The initial House bill would end Medicaid as an   entitlement to health care, replacing that with an allotment to the states for each Medicaid beneficiary. If, instead, states accepted   payments, they could gain more control over spending and more freedom to administer the program and define eligibility and benefits. Critics say that would restrict access to Medicaid in states with conservative governments. It is not clear how the federal government would calculate the amount of block grants. Nor is it clear which states, if any, might accept that option. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has already estimated that, under the House bill, the number of people without health insurance would be 14 million higher than expected next year and would be 24 million higher by 2026. The Medicaid adjustments could nudge that number even higher, a problem for many senators. The one Republican senator up for   next year in a true swing state, Dean Heller of Nevada, said on Friday that he opposed the bill in its current form. Another Republican senator, Joni Ernst of Iowa, was noncommittal. Another likely change, Republicans said, would be to restructure the tax credits offered under the bill to help people buy private health insurance. Republican lawmakers had expressed concern that the tax credits, as originally devised by House leaders, were insufficient and could produce huge increases in premiums for some people age 50 to 64. The changes in Medicaid provisions of the bill could help win over conservative House members who have expressed concern or outright opposition to the bill for multiple reasons. Mr. Palmer voted against the House bill in the Budget Committee on Thursday. On Friday, he emerged from the White House in favor of it. “We’ve never had an opportunity to do anything like this,” Mr. Palmer said later. “This will be the most significant entitlement reform that we’ve seen. ” Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, said other members were on board as well. “On balance and with the changes we agreed to in the bill’s final text, I can vote for it,” he said after the meeting in the Oval Office. Mr. Trump’s level of engagement has been a major question mark as congressional leaders have tried to sell the proposal in the face of stinging opposition from a number of directions. His show of support for the House plan on Friday provided a lift for House leaders, who have been on the defensive all week over their bill and the persistent conservative opposition to it. Conservative holdouts who still have objections to the bill may reconsider if they come under more pressure from the president. “These changes definitely strengthen our number, but also show that President Trump’s   now,” said the House majority whip, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who was at the White House meeting and recounted how Mr. Trump voiced his support for the measure. Representative Bradley Byrne, Republican of Alabama, said the changes in the bill were having the intended effect. “I can tell you, from the private conversations I’m having with people, support for the bill has built dramatically over the last 24 hours,” he said Friday. But the changes were not enough to sway the   House Freedom Caucus, which reiterated its opposition on Friday. Changing the bill to win over such conservatives risks alienating more moderate members of the House and the Senate who worry that the measure could cause millions of people to lose health coverage. The Republican governors of four states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act  —   Arkansas, Michigan, Nevada and Ohio  —   sent a letter to congressional leaders this week rejecting the House bill as written. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said on Thursday that she opposed the House bill, explaining that it would not do enough to help   older people afford insurance. “We don’t want to in any way sacrifice coverage for people who need it the most,” she told The Portland Press Herald. House Republican moderates may be loath to take a difficult political vote if they are convinced the measure will die in the Senate. “If I hear one more senator tell me that this is dead on arrival, I think my head’s going to explode,” said Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania. “That certainly is not something many members of the House find very appetizing  —   voting for something that will go nowhere in the Senate. ” The House Democratic whip, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, predicted that while the bill might be approved by the House, “It will not become law. ” Under the Affordable Care Act, 31 states have expanded Medicaid, providing coverage to millions of adults. The federal government has been paying more than 90 percent of the costs for the newly eligible beneficiaries. Republicans say this has taken the program away from its original purpose. Democrats contend that work requirements could increase the number of uninsured, limiting access to health care without significantly increasing employment.",0
51477,"Like Zimbabwe, South Africa needs leadership change: ANC official","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s ruling African National Congress (ANC) should get President Jacob Zuma to stand down as head of state after a party conference next month because like Zimbabwe the country urgently needs a change of leader, a senior ANC official said. The ANC has been dogged by infighting for much of this year as a series of corruption scandals have tarnished its image ahead of the December conference at which it will elect Zuma s successor. The party is split between factions backing Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former minister and ex-wife of Zuma, and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa for the ANC s top job. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu told Reuters that whoever the party chooses next month, the incoming leadership should tell Zuma to go to allow the ANC to clean up its act.   You can t keep him there,  he said. Mthembu said the ANC could learn from what was happening in Zimbabwe, where the ruling ZANU-PF party is pushing for President Robert Mugabe to leave his post.  In Zimbabwe they call that bloodless corrections ... We need to make the corrections immediately after the conference. How do you effect those corrections in government when the same person who might have contributed to a better degree still sits?  Mthembu asked. Mthembu is in the camp that backs Ramaphosa for ANC president and said it was important for the ANC to regain the trust of South African people after news reports that the Gupta brothers, business friends close to Zuma, had influenced government appointments and secured contracts from state firms. Both Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing. Zuma s second term as president expires in 2019, but he could be forced out as head of state by the ANC s new leadership before his term ends, as was the case with former president Thabo Mbeki.  In May the ANC said its executive committee backed Zuma after calls for him to resign, and in August Zuma survived a no-confidence motion in parliament. Zuma still has strong support in the party, including from the influential women s and youth leagues as well as in rural areas, where several tribal chiefs back the traditionalist leader. The ANC has seen its electoral majority shrink over recent years, and some analysts predict it could lose the 2019 election. Until recently that was unthinkable for a party that has led comfortably since sweeping to power under Nelson Mandela at the end of apartheid in 1994. Mthembu said if the ANC failed to emerge from its December conference with a new image it was  doomed .  It s us who got South Africa into this mess by electing Zuma to be president.

2337,A Silicon Valley Dream Collapses in Allegations of Fraud - The New York Times,"SAN FRANCISCO  —   Like so many bright, young entrepreneurs these days, Isaac Choi arrived here last year, set up shop and promised employees that he would lead them to the Silicon Valley dream. That dream is turning out mostly to be a mirage. This week, Mr. Choi’s company, WrkRiot, began unraveling in a highly public fashion. Its former head of marketing revealed that the   had been mired in internal chaos and had sometimes paid employees in cashier’s checks before delaying payment altogether. She also alleged that Mr. Choi had forged wire transfer documents to make it look as if compensation were on the way. By late Tuesday, WrkRiot had taken itself offline. The veracity of Mr. Choi’s credentials are now also in question. While WrkRiot is not widely known, the  ’s collapse has gripped Silicon Valley. Mr. Choi’s situation may be extreme, but the company’s implosion has a familiar ring to many who came west to be the next Mark Zuckerberg  —   but ended up instead at the next WrkRiot. Silicon Valley is always eager to celebrate its success stories, but the reality is that numerous tiny   that few ever hear about form the tech industry’s dysfunctional underbelly. “With the exception of the alleged fraud, almost anyone who has worked at a   has experienced most everything that went wrong at WrkRiot,” said Semil Shah, a   investor based in Menlo Park, Calif. “People don’t realize the word   is a broad concept that includes everything from a proven entrepreneur raising $15 million to a guy with money from friends and family. ” To an outsider, he said, “they’re both the same. ” On Hacker News, an online forum for techies, WrkRiot’s tale has exploded into one of the most popular threads, attracting more than 500 comments, including one from a poster who said that the  ’s experience “is pretty much a rite of passage here. ” Tech blogs have also seized the tale one called it “one of the ugliest   stories we’ve ever heard. ” Penny Kim, the former head of marketing at WrkRiot who wrote about her experience at the company, including the forgery allegations, said, “I’d heard stories about late paychecks or   failing, but who expects fraud in Silicon Valley?” WrkRiot terminated Ms. Kim’s employment in   after she filed a wage claim. She has since filed a retaliation complaint against the company and moved to Dallas, where she previously lived. In an interview this week, Mr. Choi, 35, said WrkRiot, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif. near where Intel has its headquarters, was “like any company. If you want to talk   all   have problems. ” When asked about the forgery claims, Mr. Choi said Ms. Kim was a disgruntled employee who was fired for cause and that the accusations were “unfair to my guys. ” Along with the   Mr. Choi’s personal credibility is on the line. As he built WrkRiot, the entrepreneur said that he graduated from the Stern School of Business at New York University and that he worked at J. P. Morgan for nearly four years as an analyst. N. Y. U. and J. P. Morgan both said they had no record of Mr. Choi. At least one company listed on his LinkedIn profile also could not be found. Mr. Choi, whose LinkedIn profile has since been wiped clean, did not respond to questions about his résumé. His lawyer, Bernard Fishman, said he was not aware of the allegations against WrkRiot until contacted by The New York Times. Mr. Choi set up his   in June 2015 under the name 1For. One, with a mission of helping people find the perfect job online. He brought in advisers with expertise in recruiting and data science and eventually hired nearly 20 employees, including Chinese nationals under work visas. The company later changed its name to JobSonic with a tagline, “Finally, a lightning fast job platform that cares. ” Eventually, the   settled on the   name of WrkRiot. Mr. Choi said the company had not raised any money from venture capital firms but that he had “a bunch of private investors who are    individuals who believe in the company. ” He said one investor was related to him and one was not, but would not say how much money the company had. WrkRiot’s former chief technology officer and   Al Brown, said Mr. Choi had intended to put $2 million of his own money into the company, but that only $400, 000 materialized. “I did not find out till the beginning of August that the money for the last payroll came from one of the employees,” Mr. Brown wrote in online comments this week. In Ms. Kim’s post about her experience at the company, which she did not initially identify but later confirmed was WrkRiot, she wrote that the   without consulting her, hired someone who would report to her, did not plan ahead on its business  —   and had no idea what its business really was  —   and was repeatedly turned down by investors. The chief executive, later identified as Mr. Choi, also borrowed money from employees, she said. “Nothing about that   surprises me anymore and it all seems like a horrible nightmare I was lucky enough to wake up from,” she wrote. Since Ms. Kim’s disclosures, others have told her they were also shortchanged by  . Michelle Young, the founder of the online travel guide Untapped Cities, reached out to Ms. Kim to tell her about an undisclosed   that bought ad space from her company  —   but then stopped paying. Ms. Young was eventually offered $40, 000 in guaranteed business by the   if she agreed to a nondisparagement clause. She did not sign and is still waiting for some of the money she is owed. “At some point the checks stopped coming,” said Ms. Young. “There were warning signs. Offers that seemed too good to be true. ” After Ms. Kim’s post, several of WrkRiot’s advisers and former employees moved to distance themselves from the company. Daniel Tunkelang, a former WrkRiot adviser who has worked at LinkedIn and been a consultant at Pinterest, terminated his relationship with the company and wrote in a blog post, “I should have gotten to know the company and its leadership better before associating myself with them and lending them my credibility. ” At WrkRiot, a handful of the  ’s remaining 10 or so employees gathered on Tuesday night to discuss their situation, according to a person who attended the gathering and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned about retaliation. A few were hopeful that Mr. Choi could save the company. Some of the Chinese nationals whose work visas are tied to their employment said their visa extensions were in limbo, partly because WrkRiot had missed a payment to the   company ADP, making it impossible for the government to verify their employment through ADP. By then, WrkRiot had shut down its website, its Facebook page and its Twitter account. Many of the employees are now hunting for other Silicon Valley   jobs.",0
4958,Trump Accused of ‘Environmental Racism’ in Withdrawal from Paris Agreement,"In a   leap of reason, a several journals and news outlets have accused Donald Trump of “environmental racism” by pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord. [As Breitbart News reported earlier, President Trump has already been blamed for a “war on the environment” tantamount to genocide. Now, his critics have upped the ante, projecting a nefarious racial tone onto the President’s decision.  Essence magazine said that Donald Trump had continued “his war on people of color in America” when he announced the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord. Blavity, a website that caters to people of color, said that Trump’s decision “will worsen environmental racism,” insisting that climate change is “inherently a black issue and not just a ‘human issue. ’” The Atlantic went so far as to suggest that environmental racism is “the new Jim Crow,” referring to laws that segregated blacks and whites in their use of public schools, public places, transportation, restrooms and restaurants. Since it may not be evident to readers how a refusal to bind America to a certain level of carbon dioxide emissions constitutes racism, these same outlets have helpfully connected the dots, explaining how neglect of environmental concerns is an attack on blacks. “If Climate Change persist (sic) and the world’s average temperature rises more than two degrees Celsius,” Blavity writer Dominic A. Williams contends, “it would mean widespread extinctions, changing weather patterns, droughts, strong storms, rising sea levels and consequently the disappearance of coastal cities, and a plethora of not yet realized consequences. ” These   disasters, Williams insists, will disproportionately affect people of color. Environmental Racism, he writes, “can be described as a lack of access to healthy environments and disproportionate exposure to pollutants. This means that predominantly black neighborhoods are more likely to suffer from polluted air and water than white neighborhoods. ” As Breitbart News noted earlier this week, the Paris climate accord has nothing whatsoever to do with “polluted air and water” and only seeks to regulate the emissions of carbon dioxide, a colorless, odorless,   gas that is a part of a healthy environment. Be that as it may, Williams eventually gets to the real bone of contention. “In addition to causing health crisis,” he argues, “Climate Change will cause meteorological disasters that will decimate vulnerable black neighborhoods. The warming of Earth will cause   such as Hurricane Katrina, to occur quite regularly. ” “While climate change will affect everyone on this planet, marginalized groups will always be the ones who suffer the most,” he adds. “Environmental issues, for that reason, are inherently black issues. ” In the minds of Dominic A. Williams and other key critics of “environmental racism,” a person doesn’t need to have race in mind to be a racist. If one’s actions intentionally or unintentionally affect black people, they constitute racism. The odd thing is, these same authors are silent about a national disaster that does affect blacks far more than whites, actually causing a disproportionate number of black deaths and the decimation of the black population. This is the legally sanctioned practice of abortion. The rate of abortion among blacks is far higher than among whites, with 365 black babies aborted for every 1, 000 that are born. While blacks account for roughly 38% of all abortions in the country, they represent only 13 percent of the population, statistics that have led black Christian leaders to speak of a “black genocide” occurring at the hands of abortionists. In New York City, for instance, in recent years there were more abortions among black women in the city than there were black babies born. Both nationally and in New York City, the abortion rates among black women are significantly higher than among any other demographic group. Now that is something for people of color to get angry about. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter  Follow @tdwilliamsrome",0
4247,Trump Tower Surrounded By Dump Trucks In Anticipation Of Violence,"Trump Tower Surrounded By Dump Trucks In Anticipation Of Violence 11/09/2016 
DAILY CALLER 
The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has surrounded the perimeter of Trump Tower with reinforced dump trucks in anticipation of Election Day violence. 
The dump trucks flank the skyscraper on all sides, and are supplemented by guardrails and heavily armed police officers. This morning, the building was not open to the general public and traffic crawled through a narrow corridor of trucks and police. On the street, supporters and protesters stood for interviews with a burgeoning press corps camped across the street. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump lives in a penthouse near the top of the building, which also serves as headquarters for his presidential campaign. (RELATED: Election Day Voting Has Begun – Who Is Winning?) 
Police told The Daily Caller News Foundation that the dumping beds are filled with sand, which adds weight to each truck, in effect making it impossible to run the barrier. Police decided to circle the Tower with trucks as a hedge against car bombs, or some such similar incendiary munition delivered by car. The fleet of trucks will travel with Trump this evening to surround the New York Hilton Midtown Manhattan Hotel, where Trump is hosting his victory rally. The NYPD maintained a presence around the hotel for several days, which is also closed to the public. 
Guests staying in the hotel on unrelated business must present their keycards at a security check-point before entering the premises. 
Similar security measures will attend Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s headquarters at the Javits Convention Center in Hell’s Kitchen this evening.",1
20098," WATCH: House Dem Has Had ENOUGH, Formally Starts Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump","Donald Trump is a clear and present threat to the United States of America. That fact is indisputable at this point; after all, a Senator in his own party just said so in strikingly blunt terms. However, the GOP-controlled House has been silent on Trump s dangerous antics, because they fear his lighting them up on Twitter, and they also fear retaliation by his crazy base at the ballot box. But it seems that Rep. Al Green (D- TX) has had enough.On Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Green took the floor of the House of Representatives and formally introduced Articles of Impeachment against Trump. Green began: I rise today on behalf of the many who have concluded that enough is enough. Green went on to say that Trump s being in the White House is is fueling an alt-right hate machine,  which is currently  causing immediate injury to American society.  On top of that, Green introduced his Articles as  privileged,  meaning  that the House needs to take them up within the next two days.Now, obviously this will go nowhere. Those craven Republicans don t care that Trump is destroying the country, just as long as they get every bigoted right-wing fever dream they ve had for the last eight years codified into law, with a few tax cuts for rich people thrown in, oh, just for fun.In short, these Republicans KNOW that Trump is unfit, and could even land us in a nuclear holocaust if he can t be kept away from the nuclear codes. In fact, at this point, any responsible person will do what was done to President Nixon in his final days, when he reportedly was drinking heavily and wandering the halls of the White House conversing with portraits of dead presidents. At that time, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and soon-to-be President Gerald Ford insisted that those responsible for launching nuclear weapons went through them rather than Nixon, because they knew Nixon to be dangerous.General John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and other adults in the room had better be doing the same with Trump, who is MUCH more dangerous than Nixon ever dreamed of being.Please, someone show some courage in the Republican House and go along with Rep. Green. It s time to impeach Trump.Watch Rep. Green s remarks below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty images",1
19190,"Academy Awards, James Comey: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times","(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump is quickly dismantling   policies. He revived two blocked pipeline projects: the Keystone XL pipeline, the focus of years of debate over energy needs and climate change and the Dakota Access pipeline, the target of intense Native American protests. Mr. Trump also pressed automakers to increase jobs in the U. S. But a new forecast of a federal budget deficit that could expand to almost $10 trillion over 10 years could complicate his agenda to slash taxes and ramp up spending. And the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood by Mr. Trump’s repetition of the false claim that only millions of illegal votes by undocumented immigrants cost him the popular vote. _____  2. On Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump’s pick to be secretary of health and human services, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, defended his investments in an Australian pharmaceutical company. And James Comey, above, told top agents that he’d been asked to remain as head of the F. B. I. averting another potentially bruising confirmation battle. It’s a delicate time for the intelligence community, which is looking into ties between Mr. Trump’s associates  —   including his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort  —   and Russia. Mr. Trump said he’d name his Supreme Court pick next week. The top contenders are conservatives on federal appeals courts: William Pryor Jr. known for his opposition to abortion and gay rights, and Neil Gorsuch, more distinguished by credentials, erudition and relatively muted stances. _____ 3. This year’s Oscar nominations are out. Voters gave “La La Land” 14 nominations, a tie for the most in Academy Award history. The academy also honored six black actors  —   a record. They included Denzel Washington and Viola Davis for their roles in “Fences,” above. Here is the full list of nominees our critics’ rundown of surprises and snubs reactions from some of the nominees a form to complete your own ballot and a guide on how to stream the nominated movies. _____ 4. Israel, discarding diplomatic restraint just a few days into the Trump administration, approved the construction of 2, 500 housing units in West Bank settlements. A month ago, the Obama administration declined to veto a Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlements as a “flagrant violation of international law,” and a week ago, a gathering of world leaders warned Israel to stop expanding them. _____ 5. Two days of talks in Kazakhstan on the Syrian war concluded with an agreement by Iran, Russia and Turkey to enforce a partial  . But they didn’t say how, and none of the Syrians at the conference  —   neither the government, nor the rebels, above  —   signed the agreement, and the main result was solidifying Russia’s role in the diplomacy. _____ 6. The Manhattan jail holding the notorious drug lord known as El Chapo is said to be tougher than Guantánamo. A remarkable figure in the annals of crime history, with two escapes from   Mexican prisons, he was extradited to the U. S. last week. The lights are on almost 24 hours a day, security is extraordinarily stringent, and the most closely guarded prisoners are denied almost all human contact. But it has seen several successful escapes. _____ 7. The expensive wonder drugs approved in recent years to cure hepatitis C, which can lead to liver disease and cancer, offered the hope of resolving a huge public health problem in the U. S. and around the world. But a report coming out Wednesday warns of the possibility of serious side effects, including liver failure, and doctors said the issue warranted further study. The news set off a new round of debate over the risks of expedited approval for badly needed drugs. “Benefits and side effects evolve over the long term, not over 12 weeks,” an author of the study said. _____ 8. Burning dinner might seem like a mistake. But the art of strategic charring, browning and blackening has deep roots in many cuisines. Exercised with care, it can conjure a world of flavor. Chefs are embracing the technique. Consider moles made with charred and   ingredients, above, blackened avocado and, mmm, lamb heart ashes. _____ 9. Houston is preparing to welcome the Super Bowl on Feb. 5, and its leaders are eager to show off the makeover the city has undergone since it last hosted the game more than a decade ago. A hub for the oil and gas industries and the nation’s   city, Houston is on the upswing, boasting an array of new restaurants,   green space, and cultural and entertainment venues. _____ 10.

43034,"U.S., Mexican officials try to find common ground on security: sources","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A Mexican delegation met U.S. military officials in southern Mexico on Tuesday to discuss security initiatives, sources said on Wednesday, as the two countries try to find common ground in tough negotiations over trade, security and immigration.  The relationship between the United States and Mexico has become strained after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to build a wall between the two countries to keep out illegal immigrants, drug dealers and criminals and make Mexico pay for it. Lori Robinson, chief of the U.S. Northern Command, and Kurt Tidd, head of the Southern U.S. Command, attended the talks, two people familiar with the matter said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity so they could discuss the meeting. It was one of the first known meetings between U.S. and Mexican officials since Trump became president in January, after threatening to upend years of cooperation between the two neighbors with divisive rhetoric on trade and security. One of the sources said the talks focused on Mexico’s commitment to securing its southern border to keep out criminals and illegal immigrants. The source said that U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Roberta Jacobson also attended. Mexico’s Foreign Ministry said Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray was not present. A third source said Socorro Flores, deputy minister for Latin America and the Caribbean, represented Mexico at the meeting. U.S. Northern Command spokesman Michael Kucharek confirmed Robinson and Tidd visited Mexico on Tuesday as part of “continued coordination in partner nation security,” adding that the two also went to Honduras and Guatemala. A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Mexico City said: “The southern border visit has been planned for months and gave U.S. authorities a chance to learn first-hand about the challenges Mexico faces in protecting its borders.” The spokesman did not provide further details. Mexico denied media reports on Wednesday suggesting that Trump, on a recent call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, had threatened to send U.S. troops into Mexico if the country did not step up efforts against its drug cartels.  CNN later published what it said was the real transcript from the call, showing Trump taking a more measured stance, and offering U.S. help to combat Mexico’s “tough hombres.”  Mexico’s presidential spokesman, Eduardo Sanchez, was not immediately able to comment on CNN’s report but said “it sounded more logical.”   A summit between Trump and Pena Nieto that had been planned for January was canceled after Trump tweeted that it would be better for the Mexican leader not to come to the summit if Mexico would not pay for the wall. Pena Nieto canceled. Trump has threatened to levy a hefty tax on imports from Mexico to the United States.  Mexico said on Wednesday it expected to begin formal talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement from around the beginning of May. ",0
16718,Trump: I’d Get ‘Electric Chair’ for Cheating on Debates Like Hillary,"Posted 10/31/2016 2:03 pm by PatriotRising with 0 comments Republican nominee Donald Trump told an audience of roughly 8,000 cheering fans that if he had cheated in presidential debates the way rival Hillary Clinton had, he would be sent to the “electric chair.” 

Trump was commenting on the revelation by Wikileaks on Monday that CNN commentator Donna Brazile, who is now the chair of the Democratic National Committee, had been caught again passing debate questions from the network to the Clinton campaign during the Democratic primary. 

Brazile had been exposed earlier doing the same — passing a question to the Clinton campaign in advance of a town hall debate against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). 

At the time, Brazile was not yet DNC chair, but was a regular CNN contributor. 

CNN fired Brazile on Monday, releasing a statement: ““We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.” 

Trump noted that Brazile was not the core issue — “I don’t care” about her, he said. Rather, he argued, Hillary Clinton should have reported Brazile the first time she tried to pass debate questions to her. 
Trump also talked about cheating at the polls, telling supporters that the only way to overcome voter fraud would be to vote by the “millions.” 

He cited 1.8 million dead people on the country’s voter rolls, and 2.75 million who are registered in more than one state. (The statistics appear to be based on a Pew Research Center study.) 

Trump challenged journalists in the room to ask Hillary Clinton why she had not reported Brazile after being provided with the debate questions.

8486,"The Trump Network sought to make people rich, but left behind disappointment","The salespeople at Ideal Health were thrilled when they heard Donald Trump would become the new face of their company. The New York real estate mogul, whose reality show “The Apprentice” made him famous, licensed his name to the firm, which was then rebranded as the Trump Network in 2009.

“Oh, my god, people cried when they heard it was him,” says Jenna Knudsen, who worked as a high-ranking saleswoman for Ideal Health at the time. “They cried and looked at each other and said, ‘We’re going to be millionaires!’ ”

Knudsen and her colleagues sold customized vitamins and other health products as part of a controversial business model known as multilevel marketing, in which companies pay salespeople commissions for selling products and recruiting more representatives.

Trump, whose presidential campaign is based in part on his reputation as a businessman, is well known for licensing his name to golf courses, hotels, clothing, wine and many other products. But in this case, he became involved in an industry that consumer advocates had long criticized as promising financial independence to sales recruits but rarely delivering it. Ideal Health had already faced complaints about its practices.

Trump says he was not involved in the company’s operations. But statements by him and other company representatives — as well as a plethora of marketing materials circulating online — often gave the impression of a partnership that was certain to lift thousands of people into prosperity. In fact, within a few years, the company fell on hard times, leaving some salespeople in tough financial straits. It ultimately was acquired by another firm.

But when Trump joined forces with Ideal Health, he was enthusiastic about its future.

“When I did ‘The Apprentice,’ it was a long shot. This is not a long shot,” Trump told a Trump Network convention of at least 5,000 people in Miami in 2009, his face projected onto a giant screen. “This is going to be something that’s really amazing.”

“It’s going to be our company as a group,” he added.

Sales people affiliated with the newly branded company also highlighted the relationship. “We’re working on projects behind the scenes every single day with Mr. Trump,” Kim Stone, who was one of the highest-level sales representatives in the company, says in a video that was posted online in early 2010. “Literally you will be able to set yourself up for the rest of your life, financially speaking, if you take advantage of the timing right now with this company.”

In an interview, Stone said many salespeople believed Trump would be more involved. “Initially when the owners said we’re all becoming Trump Network, they kind of led the field to believe he was financially a part of it,” she said. “And technically it was just this branding deal.”

Trump attorney Alan Garten said in a statement that Trump has always been transparent about his relationship with the network. Some materials, such as the company’s website, did contain fine-print disclosures.

“His role in the Trump Network was limited to licensing the ‘Trump’ brand and providing motivational speeches to its members. Mr. Trump was never an owner of the Trump Network. He also was not involved in the manufacturing or sale of any of the Trump Network’s products,” Garten said. “To be clear, Mr. Trump’s role in the Trump Network was clearly disclosed, to everyone involved in the company and its members, whether it be in the member’s independent contractor agreements, the marketing materials, or on the products themselves.”

Interviews with nine former salespeople and industry and academic experts — as well as court filings, Federal Trade Commission complaints and Trump Network documents and videos that remain online today — tell the story of Trump leveraging his name and reputation, only to leave some disappointed when imagined benefits did not materialize.

Trump Network is not the first Trump-affiliated company to receive scrutiny. Another of Trump’s branding arrangements has become a topic in the campaign: Trump University, which has been sued, along with Trump, for promising to teach people unique ways to make money in real estate -- a program that would cost thousands of dollars -- without actually delivering any effective lessons. Students also say they were misled about the extent of Trump’s involvement. Trump has rejected the allegations.

Some of Trump Network’s sales representatives who suffered after the company ran into trouble say the lack of commitment by Trump and the Trump Network’s owners let them down. Knudsen — who had reached one of the company’s top sales ranks, had thousands of people working under her and at one point was earning thousands of dollars a month — ended up losing her house. Her car, purchased as part of the company’s rewards program, was repossessed in the middle of the night. She said she was a single mother with no alimony and no child support, and her kids were traumatized.

“They changed us to the Trump Network, so we thought we were his company, he was invested in us. But we were just an endorsement. We were just paying to rent his name,” Knudsen said. “Was Trump to blame? We don’t know, but he certainly did not do what he said. He did not support us, he did not make this company his baby company. And somewhere between [the owners] and Donald Trump, they devastated thousands of people. And no one ever apologized.”

The road to the Trump Network

When he set his sights on Ideal Health in the late 2000s, Trump did not hint at any qualms about the industry. “I’m a big fan of network marketing,” Trump said at the Miami convention in 2009, which featured circus performers on stilts and a massive dance party.

Ideal Health was started in 1997 by Scott Stanwood, his brother Todd and Lou DeCaprio, who had worked together in the multilevel marketing business. Ideal Health’s flagship product — later the Trump Network’s — was a multivitamin, tailored for customers based on a urine test. It cost $139.95, plus $69.95 a month for the vitamins, plus $99.95 for additional testing every six months. Former salespeople praised the product, saying it helped customers live healthier lives. But some experts say it was of questionable value.

“There’s very little evidence to suggest that this test is going to provide you with clinically meaningful information, or that the supplements they provide are going to make you healthy,” said Timothy Caulfield, a public health professor at the University of Alberta and longtime analyst of alternative medicine.

But most of the controversy surrounding Ideal Health, and later the Trump Network, stems from how these companies rewarded and recruited sales representatives. Although many multilevel marketing companies are legal, the FTC has called some thinly disguised pyramid schemes.

Scott Stanwood said he couldn’t comment because of confidentiality agreements with the Trump Organization. He said he was speaking on behalf of Ideal Health and the Trump Network’s other owners.

As is common with the model, Trump Network sales representatives made money when they sold products, and when salespeople working under them made purchases. They weren’t employees, so they weren’t guaranteed a salary. And because salespeople paid upfront for products each month, they bore a lot of the risk.

A Trump Network compensation plan shows that those in sales were promised big rewards for recruitment. A hypothetical example presented by the company showed that salespeople could build “levels” of salespeople under them and would earn commissions of $100, $25 or $20 each time a new recruit bought a business starter kit for $497. “Extraordinary growth on Level 7,” the plan says, “2,187 people x $20 = A Lot of Money.”

In one complaint to the FTC, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by The Washington Post, one former sales representative recounted spending $1887.75 on starter kits and other materials. “[T]hey kept tricking me into believing that I will make money just by selling more products and inviting more people, but the rate of return is so low,” the consumer, who is not identified, wrote. “In other words, they are scamming and deceiving people, making them believe that if they ‘just hang in there’ they will make money.”

Garten said the Trump Network did not receive any complaints from the FTC. Katie Baker, an attorney with the FTC, said that the FTC does not reach out to companies to resolve individual complaints, but merely analyzes and compiles them.

Well before Trump got involved, Ideal Health had faced similar questions about its business practices, according to documents made public by a 2004 Freedom of Information Act request by the Minneapolis law firm Mansfield Tanick & Cohen.

Sales representatives said they paid thousands of dollars for leadership programs, infomercials, starter kits and other materials that they never recovered in sales. One consumer said they joined the company expecting to make a five-figure monthly income, but instead ended up spending $8,956.20 on promotional materials. Another claimed they were encouraged to mortgage their home for $70,000 to buy shares in TV advertising.

“They try to use people[’]s hopes and dreams to empty their wallets,” reads one complaint.

Trump was not new to multilevel marketing. He already had been involved for several years with ACN Inc., a company that sells phone and other services. According to documents released earlier this year by his campaign, in 2014 and 2015 Trump received $1.35 million in fees for three speaking engagements with ACN. ACN said that Trump was a paid keynote speaker at several company events, as were many other industry and business experts, and that he was not involved in any other facet of the business.

Trump was introduced to Ideal Health in early 2008 through Dean Blechman, a former chief executive of Ideal Health, and another associate, according to a court document from a subsequent separation lawsuit between Blechman and Ideal Health.

Ideal Health was “under-capitalized,” Blechman said, and the company was seeking a partnership to expand its recognition. So he and two other business contacts arranged a meeting with Trump at his office in Manhattan. Blechman says Trump liked the idea of promoting health, as well as creating jobs and income for people through direct marketing.

“I brought the company a hundreds-of-millions-of-dollar revenue opportunity,” Blechman said. “There was nobody in the world, nobody, not a single person in the world, that was more perfect than Donald Trump.”

At first, Trump considered taking a stake in the company, according to the court document. Trump’s attorney Garten said the billionaire “became involved with the Trump Network because he believed in the strength of the management team,"" but said only a licensing agreement was ever envisioned. Ultimately, in March 2009, the parties settled on an agreement in which Ideal Health would license Trump’s likeness and trademarks, and Trump would promote its products.

Trump’s endorsement persuaded some salespeople to quit their day jobs and recruit friends, family and neighbors to join, according to interviews and contemporary news stories. The network grew to more than 20,000 people, from 5,000 before his involvement, the Boston Globe reported in 2010.

As many Americans were confronting the aftermath of the financial crisis and the Great Recession, Trump touted the network as a salvation.

“The economic meltdown, greed and ineptitude in the financial industry have sabotaged the dreams of millions of people. Americans need a new plan,” he said in an introductory video. “They need a new dream. The Trump Network wants to give millions of people renewed hope, and with an exciting plan to opt out of the recession.”

Sara Harper, a former Trump Network saleswoman in San Diego, said the overall message she and her colleagues received made it easy to think that Trump was a substantial part of the business. “A picture was painted that he was involved at a level of business decision-making that I don’t think he really was,” she said.

Several salespeople said that following in Trump’s footsteps was a major attraction.

People saw the Trump Network as an opportunity to be associated with “the biggest business brand in the world,” says Lenny Izzo, a chiropractor who was one of the Trump Network’s top salespeople.

“With Trump coming in, they hyped it up to make us believe, oh, it’s not going to take us long now; we’re going to make money so much faster,” said Yvonne Zook, who was a mid-level sales representative.

But over the next few years, according to several of the salespeople, far fewer people started showing up at the annual conferences. And by late 2011, some suddenly stopped receiving their payments and began to leave the company.

Garten said many people enjoyed financial success with the network. ""But, like with any business venture, you get what you put into it,” he said.

He added that any problems at the Trump Network that came up ""were solely the result of the financial crisis.""

Others, though, suggest alternative reasons for why the company struggled, including mismanagement and profligacy by the owners, such as spending on a new office and flashy promotional events, and an awkward fit between the Trump brand and a health and wellness product.

Some sales representatives don’t criticize Trump for the business’s struggles, saying he did his best in a limited relationship. “He did exactly what he was asked to do. And I think that’s why people were excited, because they thought that this could be the turnaround for the company, because they felt that he had the business sense,” said Carolyn Connolly, a top saleswoman.

According to public records, the Trump Network’s owners, Todd and Scott Stanwood and Lou DeCaprio, filed for bankruptcy. The trio lost the 8,000-square-foot home with an infinity pool where they lived together north of Boston.

Around the end of 2011, Trump’s licensing contract ended, and in early 2012 the business was sold to another company, Bioceutica, for an undisclosed sum. Trump’s attorney says those in sales who signed on with Bioceutica received outstanding payments. Bioceutica declined to comment.

Izzo says that Trump could have saved the company “if he had stepped in … but he didn’t have good reason to do that.” Izzo, who also went bankrupt, added: ""Could he have approached this differently? Absolutely. Could he have taken less fees, could he have stepped in and guided the company differently? He could have, but that wasn’t the choice.”

5198,"Chris Christie kicks off his comeback tour in N.H., going all-in on entitlement reform","GOFFSTOWN – Chris Christie kicked off a two day swing to New Hampshire with a sober prescription for tackling escalating entitlement spending.

The New Jersey governor and potential Republican presidential candidate proposed raising the retirement age for Social security to 69, means testing for Social Security, and gradually raising the eligibility age for Medicare.

Christie outlined his proposals on entitlement reform at a speech Tuesday morning at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.

“In the short term, it is growing the deficit and slowly but surely taking over all of government. In the long term, it will steal our children’s future and bankrupt our nation. Meanwhile, our leaders in Washington are not telling people the truth. Washington is still not dealing with the problem,” Christie said.

“Washington is afraid to have an honest conversation about Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid with the people of our country. I am not,” the governor added.

Christie said that Social Security should be retirement insurance, and he proposed what he described as “modest” means testing.

“Let’s ask ourselves an honest question: do we really believe that the wealthiest Americans need to take from younger, hardworking Americans to receive what, for most of them, is a modest monthly Social Security check? I propose a modest means test that only affects those with non-Social Security income of over $80,000 per year, and phases out Social Security payments entirely for those that have $200,000 a year of other income,” Christie said.

He added that his proposal would only affect 2 percent of all Social Security recipients.

When it comes to Medicare, Christie would increase the current sliding scare of means testing.

“We should expand the sliding scale under my proposal. Seniors with an $85,000 a year income will pay 40% of premium costs and increasing it to 90% above $196,000 a year in retirement income, Christie said.

Christie also proposed raising the retirement age for Social Security.

“I’m proposing we raise the age to 69, gradually implementing this change starting in 2022 and increasing the retirement age by two months each year until it reaches 69. I also believe we need to raise the early retirement age – people who take their retirement early -- at a similar pace, raising it by two months per year until it reaches 64 from the current level of 62,” Christie

And he also called for raising the eligibility age for Medicare at what he described as “a manageable pace of one month per year, so that by 2040, you’d be eligible for Medicare at 67 years old, and by 2064 would be 69 years old. Raising the eligibility age, slowly so that people can plan for it, has another advantage. It encourages seniors to remain in the workforce.”

Christie also trained some of his fire on President Barack Obama, saying the president “has left us a debtor nation. In his short time in office, he has almost doubled the national debt – increasing it by over $8 trillion.”

“It won’t be easy to turn around the fiscal mess that Barack Obama has left us either. He has avoided the tough decisions. Imagine that the straightforward discussion I’ve just had with you today, President Obama has been afraid to have with you for the last eight years -- from the day he declared for president in February of 2007 to this very day,” Christie added.

[How Chris Christie is plotting a comeback with town hall meetings]

Christie ended his speech by touting that he’s not afraid to tackle the difficult issues, like entitlement reform.

“Here’s what you’ll learn about me. I have been talking about the growth of entitlements as a big problem, at both the state and federal levels, for a number of years. Not because it is politically popular, but because it is true. And because it will affect everything we can do as a country to make this century the second American century. I will not pander. I will not flip flop. I’m not afraid to tell you the truth as I see it, whether you like it or not,” Christie concluded.

Prior to his address, Christie met with students at Saint Anselm College. After a conference call with conservative reporters who were unable to watch the speech, Christie was headed to a retail stop at Caesario’s Pizza on Elm Street in Manchester.

Later in the day he was scheduled to hold a meet and greet at the Stone Church Tavern in Newmarket, followed by a closed door Seacoast Roundtable hosted by Renee Plummer, one of the most influential GOP activists along the coast.

Wednesday Christie meets and greets voters at Chez Vachon, a breakfast spot in Manchester, before holding a town hall in Londonderry. He returns to New Hampshire on Friday to speak at the NHGOP’s First-in-the-Nation Leadership Summit.

39710,White House communications director Scaramucci leaves in order to 'clean slate',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday that Anthony Scaramucci, named by President Donald Trump as communications director only 10 days ago, was leaving the post. The change comes days after Scaramucci delivered a profanity-laced tirade against other top Trump aides - and hours after Trump swore in John Kelly, a new chief of staff, to bring discipline to his West Wing. “Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give Chief of Staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team,” the White House said in a statement.

14612,"IS Urges Jihadis To ’Dress Up Like Jews’, Carry Out Terror Attacks","TEL AVIV  —   Islamic State radicals are urging Western supporters to carry out terror attacks against Jewish communities by dressing up as Jews and using bombs, knives and  —   in the ultimate irony  —   the Israeli martial art of Krav Maga. [“IF YOU’RE STILL IN THE WEST! Dress up like a Jew! Go to your nearest Jewish area! Make sure you have plenty of weapons under your coat! Then unleash the pain of the Muslims upon these A. P. E. S!!!” a message on the   Telegram channel “Lone Mujahid” reportedly reads.  The chat room aims to help budding terrorists carry out “ ” attacks by providing PDFs and instructional videos on everything from the correct way to stab somebody to instructions for how to build a bomb. Incredibly, and without any apparent intention at satire, there are even   tutorials on Krav Maga, a martial art invented by Israelis that is based on Israeli military training. Another post on the channel contains a list of Jewish communities in the UK accompanied by a photo of Amedy Coulibaly, the terrorist responsible for killing a policewoman in Paris along with four hostages at the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket. Late last year, Lone Mujahid posted a call urging fanatics to launch attacks on Christmas, Hanukkah and the New Year. “Christmas, Hanukah and New Years Day is very soon, InshaAllah. So let’s prepare a gift for the filthy pigs   apes,” reads one post, accompanied by a screenshot of a pressure cooker   tutorial. The loss of territory and the   challenges of reaching the Islamic State caliphate in Syria and Iraq has meant that the terror group has reduced its recruiting efforts for foreign fighters. Whereas foreign IS recruits peaked at 2, 000 per month, that number has dwindled to 50. Instead, the terror group is now appealing to jihadists who are likely to carry out attacks in their home cities. IS Commander Abu Mohammad Al Adnani, who was killed in in a coalition airstrike in August 2016, famously said, “If the tyrants have shut the doors of hijra [immigration to ISIS territories] in your face, then open the gate of jihad in their faces and make them regret their action. ” Jewish targets were prized even before the January 2015 attack in Paris. Mehdi Nemmouche, a    French national of Algerian origin who claimed to be an IS jihadi, opened fire in 2014 at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, killing three people. A fourth later died due to injuries sustained in the attack. The intended targets of last year’s suicide bomb attack at Brussels airport last year were also believed to be Jews and Americans. “We know they wanted to target Americans. It’s clear they had quite specific targets.   …     We know they were obsessed with the Israelis, too,” a source told the AFP. Meanwhile, in Israel, a Jewish Israeli who converted to Islam after serving in the Israeli army was arrested last month after trying to join the Islamic State in Syria, the Shin Bet security agency said on Wednesday.",0
590,Blackhawks Roster Breakdown: Forwards,"Blackhawks Roster Breakdown: Forwards
(Before It's News)
With opening night less than a week away, the Blackhawks are down to some tough decisions with their roster. We talked at length about the options on Tuesday night’s Shoutcast, but there are some real questions. I’m going to break down some of the upcoming roster decisions or at least try to lay them out in a logical manner. This doesn’t mean Joel Quenneville will decide to use the logical method. Lastly, we look at the offense:
Brandon Saad – Jonathan Toews – Richard Panik
This is your first line, and it has been since the day the Blackhawks traded Artemi Panarin for Brandon Saad back in June. We all know what we are going to get from Saad and Jonathan Toews. Richard Panik is a bit more of a wild card. No one believed me when I predicted that Panik could easily replace the 34 points that were sent to Montreal with Andrew Shaw. No only did Panik replace the points, but he eclipsed it. By a decent margin. He played all 82 games, and contributed 22 goals, 22 assists for 44 points. These are all better than Andrew Shaw has ever reached in his career. I don’t expect that Panik will have 22 goals again, but it’s really not all that unreasonable. With Saad on the other wing, Panik will have more room to work. As long as he is in the right place, he will have every opportunity to equal that 44 points. This line is light years better now than it was in April. Expect Jonathan Toews to have a bounceback typical Jonny Toews year, and for Brandon Saad to have a career year. Saad is coming off three straight 50+ point seasons, and this year will be no different. 60 points is not unfathomable.
Alex Debrincat – Nick Schmaltz – Patrick Kane
I know, the Debrincat hater has him not only making the team, but playing in the top 6. If you look at the alternatives, there really aren’t any. Unless they move Nick Schmaltz back to wing, no one else fits the position, and they certainly haven’t been playing Schmaltz at center all preseason only to dump him back at the wing. I think Debrincat will hit the wall in ten games and they will need to re-adjust but, for the moment, it won’t hurt to try this combo out to open the season. Speaking of Nick Schmaltz, this kid has impressed me. He was a pouty little brat, last season, once he was sent to Rockford and it rubbed me the wrong way. Granted he still has that pouty look on his face all the time, but his play has grow leaps and bounds. He was “good” last season, after he came back from Rockford, but this preseason he has been excellent. I would have never placed him at second line center, but that is where he has been the entire preseason. He has not looked out of place either. This makes you wonder what the future holds for new third line $4.55 million center Artem Anisimov. Patrick Kane is; Patrick Kane. I don’t want to say too much or the PC Police will come after me.
Patrick Sharp – Artem Anisimov – Ryan Hartman
If we didn’t expect to have Debrincat or Schmaltz on the second line, we certainly didn’t expect to see Artem Anisimov on the third line. If Debrincat makes the team, I’m fine with Sharp on the third line, and if Debrincat doesn’t, then someone like Wingels or Hayden can slide up. Ryan Hartman is a perfect third line player and will have a solid year once again there. Anisimov is a perfectly fine third line center, but I have my reservations about paying a player $4.55 million for the next 4 years to play on the third line. At some point they have to investigate getting him to waive that no trade clause and clear that cap room. For the near future, he is perfectly fine in the third line role. Even if he can’t win a faceoff to save his life. Circling back to Debrincat, Quenneville toyed with playing him on this third line with Anisimov and Hartman, and I’m not a fan whatsoever. He is not really responsible defensively, yet, and he is not a player that drives possession by himself. He needs to be set up for his chances, by skill players. Anisimov and Hartman are good, but they are good straight line players. They are not going to set Debrincat up with beautiful passes, or dazzling moves. I cannot see this experiment working, and you are not putting him in a position to succeed based on his skillset.
Tommy Wingels – Tanner Kero – Lance Bouma
Tomas Jurco, Jordin Tootoo, John Hayden,Vinnie Hinostroza
This fourth line is a complete mystery. You might as well just throw all the names in a hat and randomly pick them out. What you see above is not what I would select, rather what I think Quenneville and Bowman will decide. Tanner Kero is a fine, responsible fourth line center and should have that position locked down. Tommy Wingels, Lance Bouma and Jordin Tootoo are basically the same player in “small, medium, sort-of-large” sizes. If Quenneville wants to keep one of those three players as a 13th forward for the “grit”, that’s fine by me. Keeping all three is simply preposterous. My honest opinion is that they should keep Wingels and Hayden, waive Bouma or Tootoo, and launch Tomas Jurco into the sun. This is not the year to waste roster spots on players that you mistakenly signed or traded for. The problem with this entire scenario is that the Blackhawks rarely ever admit their mistakes, which means Wingels, Bouma, Tootoo, and Jurco will all make the roster. This leaves Hayden and Hinostroza heading due west to Rockford, even though John Hayden has done everything to make this opening night roster. We are only talking about 6-8 minutes a night for this line, but it is just not the best way to maximize your talent. There I go applying logic again. Please allow me to beat any logic out of my brain with a 2×4.

2717,A fudged Brexit is May's best hope,"Garvan Walshe is a former policy adviser to the British Conservative Party. He is also the CEO of Brexit Analytics. The opinions in this article belong to the author.
(CNN) In last year's referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union , Theresa May supported remaining in the EU in the quietest way imaginable.
Nearly 16 months on, she still refuses to say whether she has since changed her mind. In an interview with LBC radio presenter (and CNN contributor) Iain Dale, the PM said that she would not ""answer hypothetical questions.""
During the referendum campaign she gave just one public speech and limited her campaigning to photo opportunities for local media. (Photos of the woman who is now Britain's Prime Minister holding up an ""I'm IN"" sign are available on social media, but require some digging to unearth).
This low profile enabled her to win the Conservative Party leadership contest that followed David Cameron's resignation after his referendum defeat. She was the only candidate then acceptable to both the party's ""Leave"" and ""Remain"" wings, and appointed a Cabinet balanced between both.
But she still needed to reassure the euroskeptics: that was the purpose of her infamous soundbite : ""Brexit means Brexit -- and we will make a success of it."" I may have supported remaining in the EU then, she meant, but don't worry, I'm on your side now.
Pushed by her Brexit-supporting adviser Nick Timothy, she set Britain up for adversarial negotiations with Brussels.
The business community's preferred outcome, a so-called ""soft"" Brexit, where the UK left the political structures of the EU, but stayed in economic ones (known as the single market and customs union), was dismissed.
Moderate Cabinet ministers were forced to toe the euroskeptic line. During the campaign for the snap election May called this June, nobody even thought of questioning her pro-Brexit credentials.
Leave voters trusted her: research from the British Election Study shows that the Conservatives picked up five percentage points of support from Leave voters.
Unfortunately for the Tories, her hard line drove Remain-supporting Conservatives away, and her party lost its majority in the House of Commons.
She has since clung on to office, but as the captive, rather than leader of her Cabinet.
Yet now that she must listen to it, it is not so much balanced as it is divided. She's too weak to lead her ministers, but they're too split to make her follow.
Hence the devastating impact of Iain Dale's question about how she would vote if there were another referendum on EU membership. If she had said that she would now vote to leave, she would have to explain why she changed her mind.
JUST WATCHED Emmanuel Macron: Europe needs 'more ambition' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Emmanuel Macron: Europe needs 'more ambition' 04:36
But if she said she would vote to remain, she would confirm growing Brexiteer fears that she -- along with some of her key Cabinet ministers -- didn't really support her government's main policy.
Indeed, her deputy Damian Green (a sincere and passionate pro-European) admitted he'd vote ""remain"" again and thought that Britain would be ""better off"" staying in, but that he had a democratic duty to carry out the instructions of the British people.
All of this leaves Britain in something of a bind.
Remain-supporting members of the Cabinet know that the best hope they have of mitigating disaster is to work from the inside, under the cover of a weak Prime Minister.
If they brought the government down, the Conservative Party's grassroots would pick the most anti-European leader possible. At best, this would waste valuable time (there are only 18 months left to negotiate); at worst, it would cause the negotiations to collapse.
Leave supporters see advantage in having former Remain supporters involved so they can be blamed for the costs imposed when Brexit goes wrong. But they are starting to ask how long they can continue to support a government whose leading figures think its main policy is a disaster to be mitigated, not an achievement to celebrate.
The stability of May's government is based on the willing suspension of disbelief: Leave supporters and former-Remain supporters pretending they mean the same thing when they say they want the ""best Brexit deal.""
But when leavers believe the best deal can be obtained by threatening to walk away from Europe without a deal, while the once remain supporting finance minister warns that ""no deal"" could mean planes would be prevented from flying between Britain and the EU, that suspension is called into question.
It is becoming clear that the government assembled after the June election is not capable of carrying out the revolutionary Brexit that hard line Brexiteers, most of the Tory party's members, and a significant minority of the British public want.
These Brexiteers see their government willingly capitulating to the EU's ""intransigence."" They fear the UK will end up like Norway: forced to accept EU rules without having any say in making them.
Dale's question to the Prime Minister exposed this fundamental fact. If the hardliners want their kind of Brexit, they will have to take back control of the process. Whether the Conservative Party could survive such a Bolshevik Brexit is another matter altogether. But it's becoming increasingly clear that the best May's government could achieve would be a fudged Brexit.",0
27797, Fox ‘News’ Host’s Head Explodes Over Sanders Supporter’s Moral Stance On Taxes (VIDEO),"Fox Business host, Stuart Varney, had an interview with Nevada Superdelegate, Erin Bilbray, that made Varney get more than a little angry. Bilbray has pledged to vote for Bernie Sanders during the Democratic National Convention. Varney became  hot under the collar  because Bilbray supports higher taxes for the rich.Varney has a net worth of approximately $10 million dollars. That means the financial analyst would probably be paying more in taxes should Sanders win the White House and get some of his proposals passed. Varney argues against Sanders  proposals to make taxes a bit more progressive to address skyrocketing income inequality, saying  You re going to take it off me and give it to somebody else. I got it. Okay. Bilbray defends her position. However, Varney wasn t hearing it. Let s not beat around the bush,  Varney goes on to say.  He is going to take it off me. I already pay 60 percent of my income in taxes and he wants more. Please, don t confuse the issue, he is going to take it off me and give it to somebody else. If you think that s okay, that s fine with me. I don t. Let me move on. Varney, seemingly not wanting to have a conversation about facts or policy, insists on having a conversation about the morality of having the rich pay a higher share of taxes. Bilbray says that she wasn t prepared to have a conversation about morality. Though she thinks it isn t moral for people to be working as they as they are and still struggle just to get by.Varney only repeats his earlier position, while steadily growing angrier.Now, Sanders himself has called income inequality  the great moral issue of our time.  Sanders has revealed himself to have a humanist philosophy on morality. Sanders also happens to have a lot of respected economists who agree with his tax policy proposals too. Sanders recently explained his spirituality, saying: I believe that, as a human being, the pain that one person feels, if we have children who are hungry in America, if we have elderly people who can t afford their prescription drugs, you know what, that impacts you, that impacts me. And I worry very much about a society where some people spiritually say,  It doesn t matter to me. I got it, I don t care about other people.  So my spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me. That s my very strong spiritual feelings. It would be a pleasure to see a gentleman like Sanders have this conversation with Varney.You can watch the interview below:Featured image from video screenshot.",1
6941,FBI Director James Comey’s Internal Memo On Hillary Investigation Was Just LEAKED,"Pinterest 
An internal letter to FBI employees from Director James Comey has just been leaked. 
The memo reveals some startling information that Democrats, and the liberal media, certainly would have preferred to keep hidden from the public. 
Among other things, we’ve learned that Comey believed the election required full disclosure regarding the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email scandal. 
Here is the full text: 
To all: 
This morning I sent a letter to Congress in connection with the Secretary Clinton email investigation. Yesterday, the investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case. Because those emails appear to be pertinent to our investigation, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them. 
Of course, we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record. At the same time, however, given that we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression. In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it. 
Jim Comey 


We’ve really got to hand it to Comey in this case. By all appearances, he decided to move quickly on this matter not in spite of , but because of the election. 
Now, the truth might turn out to be quite different from this take on things, but for right now, our judgments should be based on the reliable information at hand. 
And as it stands, Comey seems by all appearances to be genuinely interested in getting to the bottom of this Hillary email mess BEFORE the election, if at all possible. 
That’s admirable, especially coming from a public official. 
We’ll just have to wait to see what comes from it, and if Director Comey will stick with his guns. 
The survival of American democracy may depend on it.",1
5672,Here’s What Happens in Your Brain When You Lie,"posted by Eddie A new study revealed that consistent small lies could alter the way on how a certain part of the brain associated to negative emotions respond to lie, desensitizing our brain in the process and encourages bigger lies in the future. The study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience , is the first to provide empirical evidence that telling small lies could gradually lead to larger lies. Additionally, the study is also the first to have a deeper look on the brain’s responses to repeated and increasing acts of dishonesty. “When we lie for personal gain, our amygdala produces a negative feeling that limits the extent to which we are prepared to lie,” explained senior author Dr Tali Sharot, from University College London Experimental Psychology, in a statement . “However, this response fades as we continue to lie, and the more it falls the bigger our lies become. This may lead to a ‘slippery slope’ where small acts of dishonesty escalate into more significant lies.” For the study, the researchers recruited 80 volunteers. The participants took part in a team estimation task that involved guessing the number of pennies in the jar and sending their estimates to unseen partners using computers. The researchers introduced the participants in different scenarios that may affect their estimation. As the baseline scenario, the participants were told that aiming for the most accurate estimate would benefit them and their partners. Other scenarios include over- or under-estimating the amount of pennies would either benefit them both, benefit them at their partner’s expense, benefit their partners at their expense and benefit one of them without any effect on the other one. The researchers observed that participants started exaggerating their estimates in the scenario in which over-estimating would benefit them at the expense of their partner. The exaggeration of the estimates elicited a strong response from the amygdala. However, as the Due exaggerations of the estimate continue to escalate throughout the study, the response from the amygdala declined. These findings show that the amygdala signals aversion to acts that considered to wrong or immoral. However, repeated acts of dishonesty can solicit a blunt response from the brain, reducing the emotional response to dishonest acts. Source:",1
7339,Israel: Ancient Papyrus Proves Jerusalem Belongs To Israel,"Videos Israel: Ancient Papyrus Proves Jerusalem Belongs To Israel Israel is using a fragment of an old tax bill is meant to undercut Muslims', and UNESCO claims to the important site. | October 27, 2016 Be Sociable, Share! A view of the Dome of the Rock Mosque in the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem’s Old City, Monday, May 2, 2016. 
While the UNESCO resolution which recognized the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem as a “Muslim holy site of worship” was barely reported around the world, and considered fairly non-controversial, Israeli officials have been expressing fury over the matter for two solid weeks. 
And the Muslims may have a huge, ancient mosque that has been a key part of Islam for 1,300 years, but Israel has a small strip of papyrus they found in a cave, which they’re pretty sure is a far more conclusive document, since it mentioned the word Jerusalem and was written in Hebrew. 
Israeli officials have claimed that the UNESCO resolution, in recognizing the mosque as important to Islam, was tantamount to denying Israel’s absolute and eternal control over the entire city of Jerusalem. Israeli Culture Minister Miri Regev said the papyrus strip proved Jerusalem “was and will remain the eternal capital of the Jewish people.” 
The al-Aqsa mosque was built on a site which is believed to have previously housed an important Jewish temple, and some Israelis advocate the eventual destruction of the mosque and the construction of a new temple, though the details of such a construction would be hugely religiously complicated, and since the destruction of the mosque would undoubtedly start a massive war, it is considered unlikely. Still, the far-right government wants to ensure that they have some international precedent for their claim to the territory.

Contrary to the propaganda of the Judeo-fascists, the Palestinians DID have a state – called Canaan, that lasted for over 2000 years and built the city of Jerusalem – until they were destroyed by ethnic cleansing and genocide by the J6ws for the purpose of stealing the land now called Palestine. The survivors of that genocide are in Palestine and scattered throughout the region. 
When the Jews were finally driven out of Palestine, for treachery and terrorism, the great majority of them went North into Eastern Europe. Some scattered into other regions of the Middle East and North Africa, where they integrated and lived among the other tribes before and after the transition to Islam. The J6ws that went into Europe, over the centuries, were driven from state to state because of their conspiracies, treachery, arrogance, usury and all of the other characteristics they exhibit today in Palestine and on Wall and Fleet Streets. 
After the Jewish “kingdom” in Canaan was defeated, by the Assyrians in 351 BCE, the Jews never were allowed to rise to power again. Their >600 year reign in Canaan was marked by oppression of non-Jews, marauding and attacks on the most heavily traveled trade route in the world. After 66 BCE, for a time, Rome made the error of trying to allow the Jews limited self-rule, which ended in rioting, conspiracy and terrorist attacks by the J6ws on both Romans and the other tribes of Palestine. 
From the time of the final defeat of the last Jewish terrorists in 135 CE, until the early 20th Century, Palestine was one of the most peaceful regions of the world. It benefited from a lack of obvious oil resources – avoiding attention from Western greed. The only upsets during that almost 2000 years were the defeat of the Byzantines (the remnants of the Roman Empire), the European “Crusades”, a couple of Asian incursions and a few tribal squabbles. 
By 1900, Palestine was one of the most productive agricultural regions of the Middle East and a major exporter of citrus and olives. Its “Jaffa Brand” oranges were famous throughout the world (I’ve never eaten one. But, I have a crate with most of the paper label in my office). 
The Jew claim that all of the land they obtained in Palestine was purchased is ludicrous. They went to some FORMER land owners of the DEFUNCT Ottoman Empire and paid them something to sign bills of sale to land they didn’t own and had probably never seen. 
I read one report by a British officer in the Palestine Mandate. His unit was sent to investigate an attack on a small Palestinian town. They found the ENTIRE POPULATION of the town slaughtered, many of the bodies mutilated and most of the women and girls raped, with some tortured. The animals, including house pets, had all been killed and many mutilated. After further investigation, the British Army concluded that the massacre had been carried out by Irgun terrorists and that Menachem Begin almost certainly led the slaughter. This is the sort of sub-human that Jews “elect” as their Prime Minister. 
The Zionists have the delusion that they can re-write history to suit their cult. They are sadly mistaken. Lonny 
Not contrary to you being a racist @$$hoIe, you spend every day of your life whining about Jews for several hours a day. tapatio 
NO, JEW-BOY, I SPEND PART OF MOST DAYS HELPING TO BRING ABOUT THE DAY WHEN THE DISEASE, OF WHICH YOU ARE PART, IS ERADICATED AND HUMANS CAN HAVE PEACE AND DECENCY. Lonny 
You spend part of your days hating Jews and the other part blowing jihadis, tapaDILDO. Hating Jews doesn’t make you decent. It makes you a racist lowlife. Kagey1 
Mint Press, you disingenuously fail to state the true objection of Israel to the UNESCO vote. That it fails to also include the Jewish origins of the site. In fact, the resolution appears to state that Jerusalem is only holy to Muslims. It negates the prior Jewish and Christian connections. That is the objection, not the inclusion of the later Muslim connection. tapatio Lonny 
TapaDILDO still trying to get negative attention from Jews. Little crybaby never got enough attention from mommy. tapatio 
Since the Jews invaded and committed GENOCIDE in Canaan/Palestine about 3000 years ago – yup, they were there before Muslims or Christians. The Christians appeared 2000 years ago and the Muslims came 1400 years ago. But, since the Jews’“claim” to Palestine is based on their genocide of the Canaanite kingdom after the Jews were driven from Egypt, that claim would seem to be shaky at best. 
And, ancient Judaism became functionally extinct at tel Megiddo in 135 CE – 1881 years ago. The “Jews” that we see today are the descendants of Eastern European barbarians who were converted to Judaism by the few survivors of their terrorist war against Rome. 
Today’s Jews and their ancestors NEVER saw Palestine until Rothschild’s Zionist disease. The FEW (about 17,000) Jews that lived in Palestine before Zionism were ALL Europeans, living on European charity – mostly in Jerusalem. They were ultra-orthodox whose entire function was to “study” the Torah and pornographic Talmud – the NEVER worked. 
Humanity really needs to comprehend fully that this cult, that has been driven from more than 100 countries in the last 2000 years is NOT “PERSECUTED”. JUDAISM IS A TOXIC CULT-URE THAT LIVES ON THE BLOOD OF OTHERS – VAMPIRES, AS THEY HAVE BEEN CALLED BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, VOLTAIRE AND OTHERS. 
GREAT JEWISH LEADERS 
There goes Tapadildo inventing a fake history again, as always. 
Jews didn’t invade. Jews lawfully immigrated under the Ottomans and so did the Arabs. 
Jews committed no genocide there. The Arab population grows at one of the fastest rates on the planet. 
There hasn’t been a Canaan for 3500 years… but you’re whining about it as though it was last week. No mention of all the genocides against non-Muslims over the last 1400 years? How about the ones this year? 
Hating Jews has turned you into a frothing lunatic, obviously. DumbTwat. ivanacardinale

NO Jew has more than a trace of Semitic DNA. That was almost eradicated at tel Megiddo in 135 CE. The traces that exist in SOME Jews are from the terrorists that managed to escape from Megiddo (all men) and breed with the barbarians of Southeastern Europe.

Well, then America belongs to the native, original peoples, so, the rest of us should start packing their bags and go back to where we come from. Same thing with Europe. It was a Roman Empire, so, Europe belongs to the Italians then. Can the “israelis” stop the crap of ancient documents? in which world they think they are living? During thousands of years everybody invaded, killed and squattered each other. So, if we go for history, NOTHING BELONGS TO NOBDY!! Michael Hess 
The supreme irony is that Islamophobes are always going on about how backwards Muslims are wanting to protect their culture going back to ancient times, yet Hasbarians do the same thing. 
Meanwhile, as the article states, there is simply nothing at all that is controversial in this resolution, the scandal is as made up as Benghazi and Ambassador Stevens and Hillary. 
The fact is, there was no state of Israel prior to May 14th, 1948. So these people need to get it out of their heads because you cannot claim sovereignty to a single dunam of land before that. Of course, as more people learn that Palestine was an officially and legally created country twenty-four years before Israel, things are getting far more interesting. 
Worse yet still for Israel, the rogue state has no legal hold over Jerusalem at all in the real world not rules by little fragments of papyrus and religious imagery back when people did not bathe and thought that the stars were oil lamps that someone lit up each night. 
UN Security Council resolution 476 and about eighteen others prove that Israel holds no legal sovereignty in Jerusalem whatsoever, this is precisely why the US Embassy Act of 1995 is waived every six months because by moving the embassy, that would put the US in violation of more than several Security Council resolutions. Lonny 
Sorry, moron. You are always lying about Jews. Who’s criticizing Arabs for protecting their culture? You mean, when there are those among them who ATTACK OTHER cultures that you think is an attack on Islamic culture? You think it’s a preservation of Islamic culture when ISIS began perpetrating a genocide on the Yzidis? 
There is something controversial, numbnutted goatface… They refuse to use the Jewish terms for the places, even though those are the terms which have been the prolific ones for thousands of years. 
The fact is, goatfaced Jew-hater… Israel was around 2000 years ago, so there was a state of Israel before May 14, 1948, and Jews have been praying at the Western Wall for millennia. And they certainly had sovereign land there historically. You really are one heck of a Jew-hating loser, goatface! 
Israel has plenty of legal hold over Jerusalem in the real world, goatface. See how it exercises its legal hold? Who are you claiming it belongs to? You know who REALLY never had sovereignty over a single dunum of the land over there? Palestinian Arabs. 
Your misapplication of what you think are laws are not credible. And misusing the 4th Geneva Convention is what is not valid. ivanacardinale 
You puke violence through your words, and also ignorance. Violence is the weapon of the people that has no reason. We know very well the history of that land. And you seem to invent it. And I laugh when i read every year about “Israel Independence”. From whom got the independence? From which Empire? the Palestinian? the Roman? the ottomans? or from the UN? Most countries has battle for years for independence against an empire. Israelis got it through what? as far as we know, you are being called the haggana? Lonny 
Actually, the only reason people puke around you is they see your face. 
Violence is what you use to defend yourself, stupid. You come on here and attack me… I never attacked you… and then you want to pretend you’re innocent on top of it! What a dumb hypocrite! 
You clearly don’t know the history if you think there wasn’t a Jewish kingdom there before. 
Israel got independence from a region which hadn’t been sovereign in 2000 years. The last people who ruled it were the Ottomans, and very temporarily the British. There were no nation-states in that region at the time. Suddenly, there were, because that’s how the Allies set it up after beating Germany and the Ottomans. 
Didn’t know that, did you? 
Before there was even a Hagganah, the Jews were struggling for independence there, and even when it was under Ottoman rule they asked for independence. 
You don’t know much of anything. Now, prattle back at me and pretend that I’m violent, when you’re the ignorant one who opened up their mouth at me first. tapatio

MOICHE FEIGLIN IS DEPUTY SPEAKER OF THE ISRAELI KNESET. BELOW IS THE HEBREW TEXT FROM FEIGLIN’S FACEBOOK PAGE. THIS CREATURE IS TYPICAL OF THE JEWISH ANIMALS THAT HAVE INVADED PALESTINE. 
TRANSLATION OF FEIGLIN’S FACEBOOK POST………….. 
With God’s Help Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Mr. Prime Minister, We have just heard that Hamas has used the ceasefire to abduct an officer. It turns out that this operation is not about to be over any too soon. The failures of this operation were inherent to it from the outset, because: a) It has no proper and clear goal; b) there is no appropriate moral framework to support our soldiers. What is required now is that we internalize the fact that Oslo is finished, that this is our country – our country exclusively, including Gaza. There are no two states, and there are no two peoples. There is only one state for one people. Having internalized this, what is needed is a deep and thorough strategic review, in terms of the definition of the enemy, of the operational tasks, of the strategic goals, and of course, of appropriate necessary war ethics. (1) Defining the enemy: The strategic enemy is extremist Arab Islam in all its varieties, from Iran to Gaza, which seeks to annihilate Israel in its entirety. The immediate enemy is Hamas. (Not the tunnels, not the rockets, but Hamas.) (2) Defining the tasks Conquest of the entire Gaza Strip, and annihilation of all fighting forces and their supporters. (3) Defining the strategic goal: To turn Gaza into Jaffa, a flourishing Israeli city with a minimum number of hostile civilians. (4) Defining war ethics: “Woe to the evildoer, and woe to his neighbor” In light of these four points, Israel must do the following: a) The IDF [Israeli army] shall designate certain open areas on the Sinai border, adjacent to the sea, in which the civilian population will be concentrated, far from the built-up areas that are used for launches and tunneling. In these areas, tent encampments will be established, until relevant emigration destinations are determined. The supply of electricity and water to the formerly populated areas will be disconnected. b) The formerly populated areas will be shelled with maximum fire power. The entire civilian and military infrastructure of Hamas, its means of communication and of logistics, will be destroyed entirely, down to their foundations. c) The IDF will divide the Gaza Strip laterally and crosswise, significantly expand the corridors, occupy commanding positions, and exterminate nests of resistance, in the event that any should remain. d) Israel will start searching for emigration destinations and quotas for the refugees from Gaza. Those who wish to emigrate will be given a generous economic support package, and will arrive at the receiving countries with considerable economic capabilities. e) Those who insist on staying, if they can be proven to have no affiliation with Hamas, will be required to publicly sign a declaration of loyalty to Israel, and receive a blue ID card similar to that of the Arabs of East Jerusalem. f) When the fighting will end, Israeli law will be extended to cover the entire Gaza Strip, the people evicted from the Gush Katif will be invited to return to their settlements, and the city of Gaza and its suburbs will be rebuilt as true Israeli touristic and commercial cities. Mr. Prime Minister, This is the a fateful hour of decision in the history of the State of Israel. All metastases of our enemy, from Iran and Hizballah through ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood, are rubbing their hands gleefully and preparing themselves for the next round. I am warning that any outcome that is less than what I defined here means encouraging the continued offensive against Israel. Only when Hizballah will understand how we have dealt with Hamas in the south, it will refrain from launching its 100,000 missiles from the north. I call on you to adopt the strategy proposed here. I have no doubt that the entire Israeli people will stand to your right with its overwhelming majority, like myself – if only you will adopt it. With high regards, respectfully, 
ORIGINAL HEBREW TEXT FROM FEIGLIN’S FACEBOOK (Just in case he removes the comment, as they frequently do) 
ב”ה 
ראש הממשלה בנימין נתניהו 
אדוני ראש הממשלה זה עתה נודע כי החמאס ניצל את הפסקת האש בכדי לחטוף קצין. מסתבר שהמבצע הזה לא עומד להיגמר כל כך מהר. הכשלים במבצע היו טמונים בו מתחילתו כי: 
א – אין לו מטרה נכונה וברורה. ב – אין מעטפת מוסרית ראויה התומכת בחיילינו. 
מה שנדרש כעת הוא להפנים שאוסלו נגמר, שזו ארצנו – רק ארצנו, כולל עזה! אין שתי מדינות ואין שני עמים – יש רק מדינה אחת לעם אחד. 
בעקבות ההפנמה הזו נדרש שינוי אסטרטגי עמוק ויסודי – הן בהגדרת האויב, הן בהגדרת המשימה, הן בהגדרת היעד האסטרטגי וכמובן – בהגדרת מוסר הלחימה הנכון והנדרש. 
1 – הגדרת האוייב האויב האסטרטגי הוא האסלאם הערבי הקיצוני על כל גרורותיו מאיראן ועד עזה המבקש לחסל את ישראל כולה. האויב בעין הוא החמאס. (לא המנהרות, לא הרקטות – החמאס) 
2 – הגדרת המשימה: כיבוש הרצועה כולה וחיסול כל הכוחות הלוחמים ותומכיהם. 
3 – הגדרת היעד האסטרטגי: להפוך את עזה ליפו. עיר ישראלית פורחת עם מינימום אזרחים עוינים. 
4 – הגדרת מוסר הלחימה:“אוי לרשע ואוי לשכנו” 
לאור ארבעת הנקודות הללו על ישראל לבצע מיד את הפעולות הבאות: 
א – צה”ל יגדיר שטחים פתוחים על גבול סיני ובסמיכות לים בהם תתרכז האוכלוסייה האזרחית- הרחק מהשטח הבנוי ואזורי השיגור והמנהור. באזורים אלו יוקמו מחנות אוהלים עד לאיתור יעדי הגירה רלוונטיים. אספקת החשמל והמים לאזורים שהיו מאוכלסים – תנותק. 
ב – האזורים שהיו מאוכלסים יופגזו בכוח אש מקסימלי. כל מתקני החמאס האזרחיים והצבאיים, אמצעי הקשר והלוגיסטיקה – יחוסלו עד היסוד. 
ג – צה”ל יבתר את הרצועה לאורכה ולרחבה, ירחיב מאוד את הצירים, ישתלט על אזורים שולטים וישמיד קיני ההתנגדות במידה וייוותרו כאלה. 
ד – ישראל תחל באיתור מדינות ומכסות הגירה לפליטי עזה. המעוניינים להגר יזכו בחבילת סיוע כלכלית נדיבה ויגיעו לארצות הקולטות עם יכולת כלכלית משמעותית. 
ה – מי שיתעקש להישאר ויוכח כי אין לו כל קשר לחמאס, יידרש לחתום באופן פומבי על הצהרת נאמנות לישראל ויקבל תעודת זהות כחולה בדומה לזו של ערביי מזרח ירושלים. 
ו – עם שוך הקרבות יוחל החוק הישראלי בכל הרצועה, מגורשי גוש קטיף יוזמנו לשוב ליישוביהם והעיר עזה ובנותיה ייבנו כערי תיירות ומסחר ישראליות לכל דבר. 
אדוני ראש הממשלה! זוהי שעת הכרעה גורלית בימיה של מדינת ישראל. כל גרורות האויב, מאיראן והחיזבאללה ועד דע”ש והאחים המוסלמים – חוככות כעת את ידיהן בהנאה ומכינות עצמן לסבב הבא. 
אני מתריע שכל תוצאה שהיא פחות ממה שהוגדר כאן, משמעותה עידוד המשך האופנסיבה נגד ישראל. רק אם יבין החיזבאללא כיצד טופל החמס בדרום, ימנע מלשגר את 100,000 הטילים שלו – מצפון. 
אני קורא לך לאמץ את האסטרטגיה המוצעת כאן. אין לי כל ספק שכמוני, עם ישראל כולו יעמוד ברוב מוחץ לימינך – אם רק תאמצנה.

Jew-boy, you fail to comprehend that I couldn’t care less about your ad hominem drivel. It only reinforces the reality that Judaism, especially the Zionist form is a FILTHY DISEASE – just like its cells – YOU. 
For more than 3000 years, from their expulsion from Egypt and from the money changers Jesus is said to have driven from the temple steps to the predatory global Rothschild banking cartel to the lowest loan shark in NY, to the Internet propaganda shill, the IDF thug and Mossad scum and their rabbis preaching the delusion of a “chosen” master-race, this predatory cultl posing as religion and ethnicity has most closely resembled a malignant cancer metastasizing through our world, corrupting and spoiling everything it touches. 
When one or a few cultures find a particular culture toxic, it could be bigotry. When almost EVERY culture finds Judaism toxic, JUDAISM IS TOXIC . 
Every expulsion of Jews below was preceded by widespread and extreme crime and abuses BY JEWS. The Jews have been expelled from more than 100 countries. Listed below are ONLY expulsions that could be directly linked to RAMPANT JEWISH CRIME. They had NOTHING to do with “persecution” of Jews. However, often, innocent Jews suffered because of guilt by association with their predatory culture. 
The expulsions of Jews were acts of SELF-PRESERVATION by non-Jewish cultures.

17234,E3 Hands-On with ’Agents of Mayhem’: ’Saints Row’ Follow-Up Feels Criminally Underwhelming - Breitbart,"Volition stakes its Seoul on the success of this   successor to the world of Saints Row, but Agents of Mayhem doesn’t leave a great first impression. [Agents of Mayhem takes place in a   Row future, though it’s unclear just how much influence that the purple gangsters of developer Volition’s previous   crime series have had on the “MAYHEM”  . Still, their membership includes both Pierce and the   (and presumably resurrected) Johnny Gat from previous Saints games, so we aren’t straying too far from Volition’s ongoing universe of sandbox mayhem.   After the viral success of Saints Row 4‘s   hijinks, the development team has decided to double down on slapstick anarchy. Agents of Mayhem offers at least ten different playable characters, each with their own skills, strengths, weaknesses, and upgrade paths. Choosing the right three for a given mission, which you can then switch between playing as on the fly, into a futuristic parody of Seoul will be crucial to success. Mission difficulty is extremely scalable, allowing you to balance risk versus reward before you’ve pulled the trigger. On the ground, swapping between said squadmates is instantaneous and allows for powerful combinations of both active and passive abilities. It’s more than choosing the right weapon for the job  —   knowing who is better at disrupting shields, who can punch through armor, and who has a penchant for computer hacking is an important part of deciding who hits the streets. Vehicle gameplay doesn’t look especially impressive or robust, but it remains present. Whether or not it’s worth the time to slip into one of the many vehicles on the streets of Seoul remains to be seen, but Saints Row 4 rendered automotive transportation utterly pointless with its   hijinks so there may not be much reason for concern. Agents of Mayhem recalls nothing so much as an especially crude Saturday morning cartoon, with easily as many   as bullets. Volition’s recent games have always had a sense of humor that can be hit or miss, but the humor is (mostly) endearing. Agents of Mayhem doesn’t stick with me as much as past efforts in the demo I played, but I could see myself growing attached to members of the crew given time. Unfortunately, the game’s promise seems to have stalled after the concept stage. When I sat down to actually play, I found a game that felt like the leftover missions from an   title, with none of the freedom that implies. Though my team was aesthetically different, playing each of them was an exercise in holding down the trigger until the bloated life bars of faceless enemies depleted, and I moved to the next checkpoint. There were hints of progression  —   you can collect vehicles, experience, and shards. But the vehicles felt pointless, and I didn’t have enough time with the game to stretch my legs with some of the advancement. Switching between characters has all the gravity of weapon swapping. On one hand, it wasn’t cumbersome. On the other, it just didn’t seem to matter very much. The game’s visuals were similarly uninspired. Everything is just a little too smooth. Character models are simple, stiffly animated, and overly shiny, making the game feel more like an HD remake of a   title than the heir apparent to a beloved franchise. The animated cutscenes felt more like a storyboard   for real cinematics than something to ship with a finished title. As an ardent fan of the Saints Row franchise, Agents of Mayhem felt criminally underwhelming. Given some time in the open world, with a wider variety of team members and the opportunity to play with the character advancement system, my opinion could change. For now, however, all it did was make me wish for a true successor to the absurdly creative GTA knockoff that inspired it.",0
27455, Bernie Sanders Has Something To Say About Donald Trump And America Needs To Hear It (VIDEO),"Bernie Sanders is not known to mince words and isn t shy about speaking his mind. During the Democratic presidential debates, he couldn t have been any clearer when he summarized Republican front-runner Donald Trump. He said: I think the American people are never going to elect a president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African Americans, and let s not forget that several years ago, Trump was in the middle of the so-called Birther movement trying to delegitimize the president of the United States of America. Sanders makes it crystal clear why a Trump presidency has the potential to legitimize racism in the eyes of racists in America. Since his statements against Muslims, scores of attacks on the Muslim community have occurred throughout the United States. In addition, Trump s support of violence at his rallies with those who disagree with him have sent a message to his supporters that it s alright to use violence against those who refuse to accept the racism they support.Bernie Sanders eloquently rejected this racist ideology. He said: You know, I find it very interesting. My dad was born in Poland and I know a little bit about the immigrant experience. Nobody has ever asked me for my birth certificate. Maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin.We need someone like Bernie Sanders to unite all Americans, regardless of religion or color.Watch a video comparing these two VASTLY different canddiates below:Featured image via video screen capture ",1
10415,"Atop the Gymnastics World, Simone Biles Can’t Suppress Her Grin - The New York Times","ST. LOUIS  —   At the end of the United States women’s gymnastics championships here on Sunday night, so many gold medals hung around Simone Biles’s neck that when she walked, they clinked so loudly it made her giggle. A few times, she grabbed her medals to silence them and laughed yet again. “I always have so much fun,” Biles said later, after she had won her fourth straight national title in the   event and gold medals in three of the four individual events. The last time a woman had won a fourth consecutive national title in the   was 42 years ago. “People think you have to be serious to do a good job,” she said. “But I think if you’re having fun, you can do better. You can look back someday and say, wow, I had a good time instead of being so stressed out. ” That’s easier said than done in elite gymnastics, a sport that can be a dangerous endeavor. One slip could break bones or tear ligaments, or possibly something worse. But this    attitude in a grueling, often solemn sport works for Biles, the   defending world champion in the  . And it makes perfect sense that it works. After all, it’s fun to compete when you win and win and when the word around the sport is that you’re the best gymnast ever. Mary Lou Retton, the Olympic gold medalist in the   in 1984, has called Biles the top gymnast in history. Nastia Liukin, the Olympic gold medalist in 2008, has said that Biles is a lock for the gold medal at the Rio Games in August and that the real competition is for second place. During the   national championships here, which were a   for next month’s Olympic trials in San Jose, Calif. Martha Karolyi, the women’s national team coordinator, watched Biles’s routines closely  —   often with eyes opened extra wide. After several of Biles’s big performances  —   and nearly all of them were big performances  —   Karolyi said, “Wow!” It was a substantial reaction from a woman who is the opposite of effusive: She gave two slow claps to Gabrielle Douglas’s floor exercise on Sunday, and Douglas is the reigning Olympic champion in the  . Could it be that Karolyi was saving her applause for Biles, who can perform feats more difficult than those of any other woman Karolyi has seen in her   years in the sport? “She’s definitely on top of my list,” Karolyi said when asked where she would rank Biles on the list of history’s top gymnasts. “She’s a great combination of physical abilities and strong mind. Oh, that’s what we want. That’s a package!” Her husband, Bela Karolyi, a legendary gymnastics coach, got to the heart of why Biles is often smiling and joking when other gymnasts look stoic or pained. He, too, said that Biles was phenomenal and that he had “never seen anyone like her. ” “She can afford to enjoy it: She’s   she’s doing so easily what other people are struggling to do,” Bela Karolyi said. “Of course she could be happy. Son of a gun, I’d love to be that way, too!” He added that it was “almost a certainty” that Biles would win the gold medal in the   in Rio. Based on her performance at nationals and most of her performances of the last, let’s estimate, 1, 068 days, at least, that appears to be true. At nationals, Biles, 19, beat   Aly Raisman, who won two gold medals at the 2012 Olympics, by nearly 4 points. That means by a mile. It also means Biles could have fallen during several of her routines  —   even   on the uneven bars  —   and still have won such is the high degree of difficulty of her routines, something that sets her apart from her competitors. But there was no   stumbling from Biles this time around. While she did have some bobbles on her final two events  —   the uneven bars and the balance beam  —   she still scored 125 points in all. That’s an improvement from last year, when she won the title by nearly 5 points. It’s hard to believe that someone so good is getting even better. Maybe that’s what has put her in such a sunny mood. Biles smiled nearly the whole way through her floor exercise on both days of nationals, as if she were dancing barefoot on the lawn of her backyard, with no one watching. While waiting for her turn on the vault, she started laughing just seconds before sprinting down the runway. That’s just before she landed one of the world’s hardest vaults  —   an Amanar, which has one flip and two and a half twists. Judges awarded her effort with a nearly flawless 9. 9 for execution. Biles’s control and execution are just so crisp that her competition can’t keep up. Raisman, who was in her rotation group, watched and marveled at the ease with which Biles floated from event to event while Raisman and the other gymnasts fought to stay focused. Both train about 30 to 34 hours a week, but with much different attitudes. “I could never be as relaxed as she is, never,” Raisman said before explaining that her coach, Mihai Brestyan, had warned her not to let Biles’s   attitude rub off on her. “Mihai said when you can vault like Simone, then you can relax. Until then, you just focus. ” For Biles, the sport may just be simpler for her than for anyone else. She was made for gymnastics, with a tiny yet powerful body that makes it easier for her to launch herself into the air and twist and flip. She also has an uncanny ability to understand where her body is in the air in relation to the ground, an awareness that was noticed by her coach, Aimee Boorman, soon after she started taking lessons as a young child. Biles is 4 feet 9 inches and so springy that she might have springs for joints, although that suspicion remains unproven. The Karolyis said that the last time they had seen someone as naturally gifted as Biles was 40 years ago, when they coached Nadia Comaneci, the Romanian gymnast who won an Olympic gold medal in 1976 and scored the first perfect 10 at a Games. Comaneci was not bubbly the way Biles is, though. Far from it. When she performed her routines, she looked like a somber scientist following the steps of an equation, so careful not to misstep. She was great at what she did, but it looked like work. “Nadia kept everything inside,” Bela Karolyi said. “You had to guess what she was feeling. ” You don’t have to guess what Biles is feeling. Her grins and giggles say it all. You don’t have to guess what a massive impact she has made on the sport, either. For that, her collection of clinking medals says it all. Her 14 medals make her history’s most decorated American woman at the world championships. Reminded of that, Biles, of course, grins. “Gymnastics is a very good sport because you get to smile a lot if you want to, rather than running around on a basketball court or something, where it’s kind of hard to run around and smile,” she said. “So I like the personality of this sport. ” It’s loud and clinking, and it’s clear that the sport likes her back.",0
26373, 78 Year Study BLOWS AWAY Republican Lies About Raising Wages,"It s been about seven years since minimum wage employees have gotten a raise, at least on the national level. Few workers would settle for that, but for some reason, giving minimum wage employees a boost would crash the economy   or at least that s what billionaire CEOs tell us. A new study, though, proves that raising the minimum wage doesn t hurt the economy at all.When conservatives talk about the minimum wage, it s always about  burger flippers  and about somehow, they aren t entitled to a living wage. They also like to compare minimum wage employees to the military, who also deserves a raise, but has many of their living expenses taken care of.The whole minimum wage thing is ridiculous, you shouldn t get paid $15 an hour to flip a burger.

Johnny Iceman (@TEbron35) April 26, 2016Republican politicians are slightly kinder in tone, but not much: Oftentimes when you have the federal government or others step in and start to raise minimum wage, what happens is you take away or reduce some people s opportunity to grab the bottom rung of the economic ladder to get the opportunities and the skills that you need to move up that economic ladder.    Kevin Madden on CNN s State of the Union When you raise the price of employment, guess what happens? You get less of it. Why do we want to make it harder for small employers to hire people?    John Boehner I think it is inflationary. I think it actually is counterproductive in many ways. You end up costing jobs from people who are at the bottom rung of the economic ladder.    Paul Ryan We re telling small-business owners that not only are we going to raise their costs by a buck and a quarter, but we re also going to raise it with these cost-of-living adjustments. Here s what s going to happen: They re going to have to lay people off.    Gov. Chris ChristieIt s easy to be smug and dismissive about the people who serve our fast food. Fast food isn t about people, or really even food. It s about jamming the most calories into our mouths in the shortest period of time.While food service accounts for a large portion of minimum wage workers, there are many other industries that also pay minimum wage and only about a quarter of the people making minimum wage are teenagers. Many are single white women, often single mothers. With the exception of some of the teens, every single minimum wage worker is struggling to pay their bills and Republicans reading this (and unfortunately, some Democrats) are still shrugging their shoulders. After all, the poor aren t really people, are they? Besides, cheap burgers and made in China Walmart clothes are far more important.Well, the National Employment Law Project just proved, through 78 years of research, that increasing the minimum wage does not increase prices. In fact, during that 78 year period, whenever the minimum wage was increased, employment increased 68 percent of the time.In those industries most affected by the minimum wage, employment increases were even more common: 73% of the time in the retail sector, 82% in low-wage leisure and hospitality. These basic economic indicators show no correlation between federal minimum-wage increases and lower employment levels,  the authors write.In fact, if anything, the data suggest that increases in the federal minimum appeared to encourage job growth and hiring.Perhaps even more striking, of the only eight times that total or industry-specific employment declined after a minimum-wage increase, the US economy was already in recession (five times), technically just emerging from recession (twice), or about to head into recession (once).Source: Business InsiderWe would have about 11 million more jobs today if Congress had allowed a minimum wage increase when President Obama began asking for one.Featured image via Kena Betancur at Getty Images.

14049,US secretly using Tunisia airbase for drones spying on Libya: Sources,"Military An MQ-9 Reaper remotely piloted aircraft flies by during a training mission November 17, 2015 at Creech Air Force Base in Indian Springs, Nevada. (Photo by AFP) 
The US military forces have secretly been using an airbase in Tunisia for drone operations to gather intelligence from inside oil-rich Libya, officials say. 
The announcement was made by unnamed sources cited in a Washington Post report on Wednesday. 
Libya has been struggling to contain the Daesh Takfiri terrorists, who started expanding their presence in the country following the overthrow and death of longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011. 
The base has apparently been in use since late June in an alleged effort to support the Libyan government’s fight against the terrorists currently in control of the northern city of Sirte. 
The US has also been using bases in Niger and Djibouti but those ones are farther away. 
Efforts by the administration of President Barack Obama to Access the airbase were meant to keep drones and small Special Operations teams within striking distance of the militants and close a “blind spot” for US and Western spy agencies. 
The officials also asserted that the drones were unarmed and tasked with gathering intelligences, adding, they could be armed in the future if Tunis agrees. 
The Tunisian government is yet to issue a possible response to the report. 
Drones tasked with assassination in the North African country usually fly out of Naval Air Station Sigonella on the Italian island of Sicily. 
The reason for keeping use of the airbase secret has been mentioned as part of the Obama administration efforts not to harm Tunisia’s “young democracy,” as put by the Washington Post . 
Washington conducts targeted killings through remotely-controlled armed drones in several African and Middle Eastern countries. 
The United States claims the airstrikes target members of al-Qaeda and other militants, but according to local officials and witnesses, civilians have been the victims of the attacks. 
The airstrikes, initiated by former US President George W. Bush, have been escalated since Barack Obama took office in 2009. 
International organizations and human rights groups say the airstrikes flout international law. Loading ...",1

46981,Clinton courts Appalachian voters to counter Trump on trade,"WASHINGTON/CARMEL, Ind. (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton met with coal and steel workers in the Appalachian region on Monday in an effort to win over blue-collar voters in a part of the country with strong support for Republican Donald Trump. The real estate mogul made his own pitch on Monday to voters in areas struggling from the loss of industry, telling a crowd in Indiana he would create “clean coal” jobs. Clinton has increasingly turned her attention beyond the Democratic Party nomination fight with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and is making early moves to try to siphon support from Trump ahead of a possible match-up in the Nov. 8 election. On Monday, she met union leaders and some of the 600 workers who were laid off last year when AK Steel Holding Corp announced it would idle a furnace in eastern Kentucky. She said jobs losses in manufacturing and the coal industry in the area had been a heavy blow. “Talk about a ripple effect. It’s just devastating communities,” Clinton told workers around a table at an Italian restaurant in the town of Ashland.  While the Republican presidential candidates focus on Tuesday’s primary contest in Indiana, Clinton launched a trip to Appalachia this week that will include events in Ohio and West Virginia.     She has a large lead over Sanders for the Democratic nomination. Unions typically back Democratic candidates, and union leaders have endorsed both Clinton and Sanders in the 2016 presidential race.  But Trump’s pro-coal, anti-trade message and outsider status has resonated with some blue collar union members frustrated with Washington politicians. He and other Republicans also accuse President Barack Obama’s administration of waging a “war on coal” by imposing strict environmental regulations. “I’m a free-market guy, but not when you’re getting killed,” Trump said at a rally in Carmel, Indiana. “Look at steel, it’s being wiped out. Your coal industry is wiped out, and China is taking our coal.”     The New York businessman won the Republican nominating contest in Kentucky in March, sweeping most of the counties in the economically struggling east of the state. Parts of Appalachia, a region that spans multiple states across the eastern United States, have struggled with poverty and job losses. West Virginia’s unemployment rate of 6.5 percent in March was well above the national rate of 5 percent, according to Labor Department data. Ohio’s unemployment rate was 5.1 percent, while the figure in Kentucky was 5.6 percent. It will be an uphill struggle for Clinton there if she wins the nomination. She has pledged more than $30 billion to help regions that depend on coal, but her promise was overshadowed when she said in March that the country would “put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” And her husband, former President Bill Clinton, campaigned on Sunday in West Virginia, encountering protests from Trump supporters.   West Virginia last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996, when Bill Clinton was running for his second four-year term. He is the only Democrat who has won Kentucky since 1980. Trump will take a leap toward winning the Republican nomination if he comes out ahead in Tuesday’s Indiana primary. His success in the race for the White House may well ride on the support of Republican evangelicals. Top rival Ted Cruz planned stops to greet voters across the state on Monday, running into a group of Trump supporters in Marion, Indiana who berated him. He deployed his wife, Heidi, and Carly Fiorina, the ex-candidate who Cruz has chosen as his running mate if he gets the Republican nomination, to a coffee shop and art gallery in Carmel, Indiana. Cruz, who lags Trump in delegates to the Republican National Convention in July, told reporters on Monday he would stay in the race “as long as we have a viable path to victory.” Republicans plan to tie Clinton to what they say is an anemic economy under President Barack Obama. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus on Monday cited data released last week that showed economic growth slipped in the first quarter to its slowest pace in two years. “Struggling Americans will never get ahead under Hillary Clinton. They are going to keep getting taken to the cleaners,” Priebus said in an opinion piece for RealClearPolitics.      ",0

42314,U.S. State Department rethinks plan not to take media on Asia trip,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department held out the possibility on Thursday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson might take reporters with him to Asia after it initially broke with decades of tradition by telling the media he would not. “We are still working out the logistics for this trip, so (we) cannot yet speak definitively as to whether we’ll be able to accommodate any press on the Secretary’s plane,” State Department spokesman Mark Toner wrote in an email.”Going forward, the State Department will do everything it can to accommodate a contingent of traveling media on board the Secretary’s plane.”     The State Department told reporters earlier this week that Tillerson would not take any of them on a March 15-19 trip to Japan, South Korea and China, countries of strategic, military and economic interest to the United States. Major news organizations complained, among them the BBC, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post and Reuters. North Korea, which fired four ballistic missiles into the sea off Japan’s northwest coast on Monday, angering both South Korea and Japan, is likely to be a key topic of Tillerson’s trip. Asked earlier this week why Tillerson was not taking media with him, a State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters the plane “is too small to accommodate ... he carries a much smaller footprint in terms of personnel, and that’s not just press.”     Toner did not respond when asked whether Tillerson had tried to get a larger Air Force plane or how the department would respond to critics who described the plan as self-defeating.      Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other past State Department officials questioned Tillerson’s plan, saying that by including reporters, the chief U.S. diplomat could make the administration’s case and prevent other countries from dominating coverage of U.S. policy. Albright, secretary of state under Democrat Bill Clinton, told MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports” on Wednesday taking the news media demonstrates a U.S. commitment to a free press. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has accused news outlets of “fake news” and called journalists “the enemy of the people.” Richard Boucher, a retired U.S. diplomat who served as State Department spokesman from 2000 to 2005 under Albright as well as  Republicans Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, could not recall a time during his tenure when reporters did not fly on the plane. Since becoming secretary of state on Feb. 1, Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil Corp chief executive, has traveled to Germany and Mexico, in both cases inviting fewer media than his predecessors for at least the last 50 years.  Veteran State Department television correspondent Marvin Kalb said William Rogers, Richard Nixon’s first secretary of state, began taking press with him in 1969 and - with rare exceptions such as Henry Kissinger’s secret trip to China in 1971 - that had remained the practice.

22010, Trump’s Border Wall Sh*t Just Got Real – Texans Receive Notices To Sell Or Have Their Land Taken,"Texas landowners along the U.S.-Mexico border have begun receiving notices from the federal government saying that they re coming to either buy, or take, parcels of land for Trump s pointless border wall. According to the Texas Observer, landowners are receiving  Declarations of Taking  notices that offer a price for the piece that the government wants. If the landowners refuse that, then they may see those parts of their property taken via eminent domain.One landowner, Yvette Salinas, got her notice back in January. She d been dreading it for a while because of George W. Bush s focus on a border fence. Under Obama, she d been able to relax a bit because he focused on patrolling and monitoring the border in ways that didn t include taking land and building a wall.Now, with Trump in office, this shit has just gotten real. Whether any of these preparations happened while Obama was still in office or not, it s Trump who is pushing the wall forward as quickly as he can. It s one of his focal points, and it will be his government that buys up or takes the land.The introduction in Salinas  letter reads like this: The United States of America is acquiring property along its border with Mexico in order to construct a fence and related improvements designed to secure the border, as required by the Secure Fence Act of 2006. They offered Salinas and her family $2,900 for 1.2 acres of land   the same amount for the same land that the government offered her under George W. Bush years earlier. The tiny community in which she lives Los Ebanos lies entirely within the floodplain of the Rio Grande. That land is protected by a treaty with Mexico that forbids the building of structures that could force floodwaters into other communities, and has been an obstacle towards border wall construction.Under Trump, though, Los Ebanos seems to have become a focal point. The government has already completed surveys and planning for a wall there. Despite increasing problems with costs, the fact that crossings are down, and the fact that Republicans are voicing their discomfort with the idea, Trump keeps hammering the wall as the way to secure the border.It s impossibly stupid. People who live along the border prefer the technological surveillance and the presence of the U.S. Border Patrol to a wall because they believe that s more effective and costs a hell of a lot less. And they don t have to give up pieces of land that have been in their families for generations for that.They also know people will still cross whether there s a wall or not.Salinas doesn t want to sell that bit of land but she doesn t know what to do. The community doesn t want to allow the wall to be built through there, either, but neither can they afford to have the U.S. government sue them, and they risk having their land taken without compensation if they try to fight.Featured image by Erik S.

26475, WATCH: Ted Cruz Gets His A** Handed To Him By Chuck Todd In Humiliating Interview,"Chuck Todd took Ted Cruz to the woodshed on Sunday after the Texas Senator claimed that there s a media conspiracy against him.Cruz is currently in second place far behind Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who is close to capturing the GOP nomination.Throughout the interview on Meet The Press, Todd repeatedly tried to get Cruz to answer whether he will support Trump or not should he become the nominee. But Cruz only embarrassed himself by avoiding the question with nonsensical claims about the media and NBC that Todd called him out on. If he s the nominee, I take it you can t support him anymore, can you?  Todd asked. I recognize that many in the media would love for me to surrender to Donald Trump,  Cruz accused. It s not about the media,  Todd replied before stabbing Cruz with reality.  Senator, it s about the numbers. He may win. Republican voters are the ones rejecting you. This is not a media conspiracy, Senator. Todd continued to grill Cruz into answering the original question. Why can t you answer the question of whether you can support Donald Trump or not?  Todd asked.  You can t answer that question. Why won t you answer that question, straight forward, black and white? Cruz then accused NBC executives of being  partisan Democrats,  which Todd immediately called out as a lie. You don t get to just say that. It s just not true. Go ahead. You re broad brushing here, and this is exactly what people hate about the media and politics. Broad brushes, right? Cruz then launched into a rant about how if voters reject him the country will be lost as if he s the only person in the nation who can save it. I m not willing to concede this country,  Cruz said.  If we lose this, we lose our country. At that point, Todd dared Cruz to take a stand if he really feels that way and answer the question of whether he will support Trump or not if he becomes the nominee. All Cruz has to say is that he won t support Trump, especially if he really believes that by losing to Trump the country will be lost. Don t you think it s important to take a stand? You just said it s a time for choosing. If it s a time for choosing, say it, for him or against him as the nominee! But like a stubborn petulant child, Cruz refused to answer the question and Todd slammed him for it. Let the record show, you have not taken a position on whether you can support Trump if he s the nominee,  he concluded, to which Cruz replied that the media tried to force him to support Trump.Here s the video via YouTube:Cruz completely humiliated himself during this interview and left us no doubt about why Republican voters are rejecting him at the polls.He was given a national platform on Sunday television to tell voters that he will not stand by Trump if he wins the nomination but all he could do was offer contradictory rhetoric about how the country will be lost if Trump wins while refusing take a stand against Trump.When Cruz loses the Republican primary, he can t blame the media for it. The only one he can blame is himself because he was too cowardly to answer a simple question that would have shown once and for all where Ted Cruz stands. Instead, all he could do is complain. And whining will be all Cruz is remembered for doing during this campaign.Featured image via screenshot",1
47191,U.S. lawmaker calls on IRS chief to resign over handling of hacked data,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service should resign due to the agency’s inability to improve its defenses against hacks on taxpayer data, a Republican lawmaker said on Friday. Republican Representative Barbara Comstock said new leadership is needed to replace IRS Commissioner John Koskinen due to failures to secure Americans’ sensitive information from malicious intrusions, escalating a line of attack from Republicans who frequently criticize the federal tax collection service. “Commissioner Koskinen has provided little confidence that cyber security is a top priority at the IRS,” Comstock said in a statement shared with Reuters, adding she was concerned the agency apparently has no one in charge of cyber security. The IRS did not immediately comment. More than 700,000 individuals may have had their personal information pilfered by hackers during an intrusion last year, the IRS announced in February. That number has been repeatedly revised upward from initial estimates that were far smaller. Comstock, in her statement, cited a Government Accountability Office report released last month that found the IRS struggling to upgrade its information security plan. The IRS agreed to work toward implementing dozens of outlined recommendations. Koskinen appeared before congressional committees this week and said complying with the GAO recommendations was a priority. The commissioner has been under near-constant fire from Republicans since he took over the agency in 2013 amid controversy over whether the IRS was targeting conservative groups.  More than 60 Republicans have signed on to a resolution introduced in October to impeach Koskinen on charges that he has impeded a congressional investigation into the IRS’s treatment of conservative groups. Comstock is the first lawmaker to call for Koskinen’s resignation solely for cyber security reasons, an aide said. Koskinen is not the first Obama administration official to be targeted by Congress for his handling of cyber security. Last year Katherine Archuleta, head of the Office of Personnel Management, resigned after several lawmakers from both parties called for her ouster following the theft of personal data of more than 21 million individuals. Comstock said Friday that Koskinen should follow the lead of Archuleta and other top executives who have left due to poor handling of hacks “to allow for new and trusted leadership at the IRS.” ",0
769,"Paul LePage, the Governor of Maine, Now Says He’s Not Quitting - The New York Times","AUGUSTA, Me.  —   Paul R. LePage, the embattled Republican governor of Maine, declared on Wednesday that he would not step down despite widespread criticism over a profane threat and generalizations about drugs and race that had prompted him to hint on Tuesday that he might abort his second term. “I will not resign,” said Mr. LePage, who tried to put to rest swirling questions about his state of mind. “I’m not an alcoholic, and I’m not a drug addict, and I don’t have mental issues,” he said. “What I have is a backbone. ” Mr. LePage nevertheless said he was seeking “spiritual guidance,” had apologized for his threat, and vowed to make one change to his behavior: “I will no longer speak to the press ever again after today,” he said. Behind the scenes, state lawmakers  —   Democrats and Senate Republicans  —   exasperated after six years of political controversies and what they saw as erratic behavior, were scrambling to figure out what, if anything, they could do to formally address this latest crisis. The controversy, which has galvanized the state, started last Wednesday when Mr. LePage made sweeping statements linking minorities to the state’s drug crisis. As criticism against him swelled, Mr. LePage came to believe that a Democratic lawmaker had called him a racist. The governor then left him an   voicemail message, which he followed up by threatening to shoot the lawmaker between the eyes. In the ensuing days, Mr. LePage also reiterated his insistence that blacks and Hispanics were the vast majority of those arrested for dealing heroin in Maine. Both Democrats and Republicans have denounced the remarks, as many legislators called for a special session to at least rebuke the governor over his latest tirade. The state’s four legislative caucuses have said that they believe all four would have to agree for a special session to be scheduled. But on Tuesday, Mr. LePage’s Republican allies in the House, including the minority leader, Kenneth Fredette, announced that they would oppose those efforts  —   essentially shielding him from any official political consequence. That decision did not sit well with some other state Republicans, and on Wednesday morning, the spotlight shifted to them as the president of the Senate, whose members govern larger and more competitive districts, made a public break with his colleagues in the House. “With all due respect, I completely disagree with Representative Fredette’s position,” the Republican leader, Michael Thibodeau, said in a statement. “The Republican senate caucus has clearly stated that we need an acceptable plan for corrective action before the determination of whether the Legislature should convene is made. ” Mr. Thibodeau said many Senate Republicans were still deciding whether or not Mr. LePage’s apology and promise to seek “spiritual guidance” had allayed their concerns about the governor  —   a process that could deepen their divide with Republicans in the House and pull the controversy into a second week. “There should be consequences for our actions,” Mr. Thibodeau said, “and I think that’s why we’re really struggling. ” There is no precedent for such a situation here  —   a fact that has sent lawmakers like Senator Roger Katz, a Republican who has been critical of Mr. LePage, back to reading their state Constitutions on Wednesday to figure out what, if anything, they could do now to convene a special session. Mr. Katz, a lawyer, suggested it may require only a simple majority of the House and senate, which could reduce the House Republicans’ ability to block such a move, although he added there could be other hurdles to an agreement. “It’s never been done before, so we’re in a little bit of uncharted waters,” said Mr. Katz, who said he wanted Mr. LePage to get “a competent evaluation and follow the recommendations of the evaluator. ” Democrats have continued to call for Mr. LePage’s ouster, and on Wednesday said they were scheduling meetings with Republican leadership to discuss how to proceed. “Coming back in for a special session will be discussed and all options around the governor’s political future are on the table,” said the Democratic leader of the Senate, Justin Alfond. Mr. LePage’s six years in office here, which began as part of the Tea Party sweep in 2010, have been marked by controversy. Even as he fueled outrage among Democrats and angst among many moderate Republicans, his well of support, fed by voters drawn to his unfiltered political style, never seemed to run dry. By all indications, Mr. LePage seemed determined to again ride out the political storm. “I want to put this behind us,” Mr. LePage said, during a meeting with a select group of reporters in his office on Wednesday morning, adding, “I will never talk about it again. ” Mr. LePage spoke shortly after he met with  —   and apologized to  —   Representative Drew Gattine, the state Democratic lawmaker who had been the recipient of the angry voice mail. And in meeting with reporters, Mr. LePage spoke emotionally about Maine’s heroin crisis. But he but did not apologize for statements he made last week that linked trafficking in the drug to blacks and Hispanics. “I didn’t use racially charged language,” Mr. LePage claimed, although he also said, “Let’s leave ethnicity out of it. ”",0
584,US should hold China accountable on human rights,"Story highlights Marco Rubio and Chris Smith: In recent years, China has increased censorship, restricted personal freedoms, and violated international standards
The Trump administration should develop a policy approach that holds China accountable for such actions, they write
Marco Rubio and Chris Smith, both Republicans, are the Chair and Co-chair respectively of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. Marco Rubio is the junior senator from Florida and Chris Smith is the US representative for New Jersey's 4th district. This piece expresses solely the views of the authors and has been adapted in part from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China's 2017 report.
(CNN) Next month, President Donald Trump plans to visit Beijing, a trip that will come amid rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula, persistent trade concerns and a raft of other thorny issues in US-China relations. While the President has sought to build a strong personal relationship with Chinese President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping -- in part to yield cooperation on North Korean proliferation -- the administration must develop a long-term policy approach that challenges China to abide by its international commitments, adhere to universal standards and embrace the rule of law.
Sen. Marco Rubio
Rep. Chris Smith
Principled American leadership is needed now more than ever. In recent years, the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China's (CECC) annual reports have found that under President Xi's leadership, China has failed to deliver on long-promised economic reforms and has become more authoritarian domestically. It is also increasingly dismissive of international norms and ""Western"" ideas, and more assertive in its extraterritorial reach. The CECC's 2017 Annual Report, which will be released on Thursday, documents even more regression.
Although President Xi has stressed the need for global connectivity and openness, domestic censorship leaves little room for journalism and public debate -- just last week the use of WhatsApp, a popular messaging app, was blocked. As stated in the report, China ""continues to strengthen the world's most sophisticated system of internet control and press censorship and forges ahead with what it calls 'internet sovereignty.'""
Xi has worked hard to consolidate his power, demanding strict ideological discipline from Party and government officials and using an extensive anti-corruption campaign to eliminate many of his political rivals.
Over the past year, Chinese authorities targeted labor and environmental activists; demanded loyalty from scholars and intellectuals; and clamped down on foreign non-governmental organizations, media outlets, think tanks, and internet companies. Restrictions on religious freedom also intensified, particularly in ethnic minority Tibetan and Uyghur areas. Coercive enforcement of population control policies continued in violation of international standards. And the government persisted in forcibly repatriating North Korean refugees to face near certain persecution and even death, in contravention of China's international legal obligations.

7044,Save the Children Norway trialed anti-malaria drug Larium in Mozambique—1993–1994,"Save the Children Norway trialed anti-malaria drug Larium in Mozambique—1993–1994 By Moeen Raoof   Moeen Raoof 
Roche AG, a Swiss multinational health-care company, needed to trial a new anti-malaria drug, Mefloquine, also known under the brand name Lariam, in malaria-prone areas of Africa. This was despite known serious side effects, including long-term health problems such as depression, hallucinations, anxiety and neurological effects such as poor balance, depression and impaired mental health. 
The Norwegian Chapter of Save the Children, also known as Redd Barna, operated in Mozambique under a Dutch national. Redd Barna began to distribute Lariam in Mozambique between 1993 to 1994. This drug was given to men, women and children, including pregnant women. 
The Lariam trials were conducted by distributing the drug based on the criteria of prevention and treatment of malaria and without due regard to age, medical status, or state of pregnancy. Recipients of the drug were not told of the side-effects but were actively monitored during the period of treatment, which lasted approximately 18 months, after the commencement of distribution. These trials were conducted without the consent of the Mozambican government or the Ministry of Health. 
Children as young as 3-years old were given whole pills to take during either the prevention or treatment phases, without regard to the side effects of the pills on very young children. Pregnant women and women with babies were also given the drug, but only if they had contracted malaria, not preventatively. 
The trials were more common among Mozambican men and women between the ages of 18 and 60 years, divided into prevention and treatment risk groups. They were provided a course of treatment, accordingly. One assumes that these persons were closely monitored for symptoms and side effects during and after the treatment period. 
Many young Mozambicans during and after the treatment period began showing signs of unusual behaviour, including bouts of violence after the testing of the drug ended in 1994. There was an increase in violent crime as well as murders in Mozambique. This, despite there being a very low crime and murder rate among civilians prior to 1993, including during the civil war that had ended 1990. 
Media in Mozambique explained away this increase in crime and murder post-1993 as drug-related, linking the violence to the use of the Methaqualone/Mandrax drug that was allegedly smuggled in from South Africa. However, this drug could not justify the rising cases of mental illness among all age groups, in users and non-users alike. Mandrax was the prime and only suspect drug blamed for all ills in Mozambique during the 1990s. As to why the wide use of Lariam was not considered as a possible cause relating to increase in violence, mental illness, crime, including murders remains a mystery. 
The Mozambican Civil War began in 1977, two years after the end of the war of independence. It resembled the Angolan Civil War in that both were proxy battles of the Cold War that started soon after the countries gained independence from Portugal. The ruling party, Front for Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO), and the national armed forces (FAM), were violently opposed from 1977 by the Mozambique Resistance Movement (RENAMO), which received funding from white-ruled Rhodesia and later, apartheid South Africa. About one million people died in fighting and from starvation; five million civilians were displaced, and many were made amputees by landmines, a legacy from the war that plagued Mozambique for more than two decades afterward. Fighting ended in 1992 and the country’s first multi-party elections were held in 1994. 
Roche admitted that Lariam had worse side effects than other common antimalarials. The head of drug safety and quality at Roche admitted that a study had shown there was an “increased risk” of neuropsychiatric problems compared to other drugs available. Roche further stated that anyone with pre-existing conditions such as depression should not be given the drug, stating that, “There is an increased risk but the balance of risk to the balance of benefit is still believed to be important in this global endemic, if it is prescribed to the right people.” 
Roche further stated, “The patient should be informed of these increased risks with Lariam and should they become aware of any of those features, a change in mood, a change in personality—then they are advised to immediately contact a doctor and stop taking it.” 
Medical advice regarding Lariam recommends the following, do not take Lariam if patients have or have previously experienced: an allergy to Mefloquine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine or to similar medicines such as quinine or quinidine depression, thoughts about suicide and self-endangering behaviour any other mental problem, including anxiety disorder, schizophrenia or psychosis (losing touch with reality) fits (seizures or convulsions) severe liver problems Blackwater fever (a complication of malaria that affects the blood and kidneys) 
Warnings and precautions—Lariam may cause serious mental problems in some people. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following while taking Lariam: suicidal thoughts",1
46691,Senators renew push to overhaul military handling of sex assault,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators renewed an effort on Tuesday to shift the military’s handling of sexual assault cases from top commanders to independent prosecutors, insisting that the current system has left victims too fearful of retaliation to report crimes. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat who has fought to overhaul the system for three years, introduced the legislation as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a must-pass annual bill that sets policy for the Pentagon. The measure failed to pass the Senate in March 2014, though Gillibrand, who sits on the armed services committee, said those votes were cast amid “false and misleading information” the Pentagon used to bolster its own argument. “We know far more now about the extent of the military sexual assault problem than we did a year ago, and it’s clear that nothing has changed,” Gillibrand said at a news conference alongside both Democratic and Republican senators. The current system requires military commanders to handle sexual assault cases within the ranks. Supporters of the bill say the system is flawed because commanders can be unwilling to prosecute such cases and victims, fearing retaliation, are often afraid to report them.  Top military leaders at the Pentagon contend that prosecutions must remain with commanders to maintain good order and discipline. “Nobody should be forced to go to their boss to report a rape,” Republican Senator Rand Paul said. The bill failed by 55-45 in 2014. Gillibrand said she has attempted to contact every senator who previously voted against the bill and is “very hopeful” the measure will this time gain the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate. “I think many senators that we’ve spoken to are concerned, deeply concerned,” she said. “The military continues to say, ‘We got this,’ ... but it’s not shown in the data. It’s not shown in the survivors’ testimony.” She said the bill has not gotten support from Republican Senator John McCain, the chairman of the armed services committee, though she has spoken to him several times about the issue. Samantha Jackson, who said she was raped by her husband when he was in the Army, said the military told the U.S. attorney’s office they would investigate, only to drop her case without pursuing charges. Jackson called her treatment “a profound betrayal,” adding, “I don’t understand how the Army could fail to hold my rapist accountable.” ",0
56291,London mayor says Britain should not host President Trump on state visit,"LONDON (Reuters) - London Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Sunday that it would be wrong for Britain to host U.S. President Donald Trump on a state visit, describing some of the U.S. leader s views on Islam as  ignorant . Khan and Trump have a history. During the U.S. presidential election campaign, Khan was among many people who spoke out against Trump s proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States, an idea he said would play into the hands of extremists. Trump has criticized Khan, accusing the mayor of making a  pathetic excuse  over his statement urging Londoners not to be alarmed by the presence of additional police on the streets in response to an attack in June. At the annual conference of his opposition Labour Party, Khan told an audience with GuardianLive that he thought having a state visit, which Prime Minister Theresa May has said is still planned, was  wrong .  I sometimes think people are ignorant,  he said, adding that it was his job to educate them. ",0

Disinformation. Misinformation. Propaganda. Outright lies. Purposeful distractions. Misleading bias. All tools of the government and close ally, corporate media, to keep the public unwise to the depth and breadth of imperialistic actions taking place around the world — and ever-encroaching surveillance and police states inside the borders of the United States. 
Perhaps you have been fortunate enough to begin pulling back the curtain on the inner workings of the government — the tandem dealings by politicians, regardless of party affiliation — to exploit the public in as many ways possible for the profits of elite politicians, corporations, industries, and banks. 
And what frequently starts as a trickle of paradigm-shifting new information, quickly forces open the floodgates — as the realization things aren’t at all as they hammered into your psyche for years through State-sponsored indoctrination of public education. It can be overwhelming — and you likely want to ‘wake up’ others to this reality — but there are pitfalls in doing so, marked by the same tactics the State employed to fool you in the first place. 
Disinformation. Misinformation. Propaganda. Outright lies. Purposeful distractions. Misleading bias. 
Sound familiar? 
With the sheer amplitude and magnitude of corruption exposed on a daily basis in the lead-up to the November 8th presidential election, alerting friends and family could seem more imperative than ever — but the aforementioned traps should and must be avoided at all costs — even when it comes from outlets posing as an answer to the mainstream. Let it be noted, that is not to decry credible, consistent independent and alternative media outlets — but it’s crucial to employ critical thinking and a bit of research to separate those with integrity from the mendacious and misleading. 
Spreading misinformation, false reports, and surreptitious propaganda does nothing to further the cause of truth — and, in fact, serves more to harm the credibility of legitimate reports in opposition to the dominant State narrative. Social media, however, has provided plenty of dry tinder for faulty info to spread like wildfire — either by the haplessly unaware, or by those with motives to ensure it quickly disseminates to cast doubt in the public mind. 
But there are a number of ways to divine authentic, genuine information from that meant to distract, divide, discredit, and delegitimize. 
Merriam-Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary defines ‘disinformation’ as “false information deliberately and often covertly spread (as by the planting of rumors) in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth.” 
So common is disinformation, those familiar with it will destroy said item with facts before it gains traction in public forums — but rumors being rumors, sometimes take on a life of their own. Checking whether or not a new report has any basis is usually as easy as a web search for secondary reports from known credible sources parroting the same claim — indeed, one surefire clue a report might be false, or even satire, is a lack of hyperlinks to other sources. 
Misinformation, on the other hand, can present a trickier issue in that it can have at least a kernel of truth at its core — but the packaging, which can include blatant lies or opinion misconstrued as fact, intends to mislead. 
Political and elections polls tilt public opinion, and — when convincing — can even dissuade people from voting on candidates and issues they might otherwise deem critical. In fact, selectively cherry-picking a sampling pool — or crafting targeted questions — will dramatically and sometimes ridiculously fit results to glean a desired answer. Zero Hedge, for example, caught ABC News and the Washington Post in the act over the weekend, after their joint poll showed Hillary Clinton with a double-digit lead over Donald Trump — despite increasingly heated controversy from John Podesta’s leaked emails. 
Every government on the planet employs propaganda to garner favor for policy and legislation — and more subtly to inculcate the citizenry into hollow feelings of nationalism, which serves little purpose other than fueling separation and pride based on the arbitrary geopolitical happenstance of one’s birth. Although the most cunning propaganda is virtually imperceptible, this year’s narrative of Russian aggression couldn’t be more patently obvious if it tried. 
However, that’s not to say the same idea of a Russian threat hasn’t also crept into reports from supposed ‘analysts,’ as well. A number of generally credible outlets, rather than presenting analysis with open-ended outcomes, have taken the government’s cue to warn of impending nuclear war at Pres. Vladimir Putin’s behest — despite a lack of evidence to back the claim. Fearmongering, it should be noted, is a common tool of propagandists worldwide. 
Outright lies and deliberate distractions go hand-in-hand when it comes to parsing truth from fiction — and an unfortunately growing number of tabloid-esque outlets peddle absurd lies as truth in the interest of getting clicks. Notably, differentiating tabloid sites from credible alternative sources can be the most difficult to the newly ‘awakening’ truth-seeker. 
A fine line exists between attention-grabbing headlines topping truthful articles and head-turning captions screaming wholescale lies. Indeed, considering the populace-at-large now champions an attention span less than that of a goldfish, convincing readers to venture past the first two sentences of a legitimate article can be the most frustrating facet of the job of independent media journalist. Scammers and profit-seekers capitalize on the fact most will share a link without ever bothering to view its contents — no matter if the work constitutes so much garbage. 
Although it isn’t an absolute guarantee, a wise axiom to follow stands the test of time: If it sounds too good or too absurd to be true, it probably is. If you’re still uncertain, ask someone you trust, seek a second and third and fourth source, and, above all, do a little digging — after all, the Internet puts the world at everyone’s fingertips. 
Journalism is not meant to be devoid of bias — on the contrary, good journalism persuades. However, bias can be employed in the extreme, easily bordering on misinformation. A topic proffered by FOX News and MSNBC will never be reported the same way — each has clear political bias and an agenda to push. Bias doesn’t have to be quite so flagrant to be effective. 
So-called political pundits are a common tool used by corporate media to subtly infuse bias by appealing to the public trust of a putative ‘expert’ in the particular topic of discussion — and pundits are usually just political or party insiders, ex-government employees, and others with a vested interest in ensuring public opinion sways in a certain direction. Also, pundits and experts nearly always receive compensation for their input. 
A stellar recent example of a biased opinion presented as expert assessment came from former assistant FBI director James Kallstrom — a known devotee of presidential candidate Donald Trump — who castigated the Clintons for being a “crime family.” While that point is debatable, the fact Kallstrom appeared as a former official of the government connoted insider knowledge — an appeal to his ostensible authority — and his diatribe went viral nearly immediately for its incendiary nature. It isn’t so much that his opinion didn’t deserve to be shared, but that it needed to be considered in light of his political desires — his characterization of the Clintons directly feeds Kallstrom’s desire for Trump to win the White House. 
While each of these topics could and have filled tomes, hopefully this provides a gentle reminder to be wary of believing everything you read. As any journalist worth their salt will say, if you don’t believe what’s written, research it on your own. Follow links provided. Seek new information. Open your mind to new ideas and be willing to part with indoctrinated thoughts that no longer serve you. 
But don’t be fooled — and it behooves all of us not to spread the sort of faulty information that discredits the general movement to expose the government’s innumerable lies. Share Google + The Kali Whrite Boi 
Well, the evidence is substantial: The Clintons are a crime family. And in regard to bias: any degree of journalistic bias is a complete lack of journalistic integrity. imho Hawkeyerightsmart 
Thanks for the article. I try to do my best. I also ask that you make sure the pipeline protesters are legit. That looks suspiciously like the scenario that unfolded in Canada when protesters paid by interests in the US and elsewhere crippled our industry.

57716,Zimbabwe to start compiling new voter register next week,"HARARE (Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe on Friday said Zimbabwe will begin compiling a new voter register next week ahead of the 2018 presidential and parliamentary elections, in which the 93-year-old is seeking to extend his 37-year hold on power. Mugabe said in an official government notice that the  Zimbabwe Electoral Commission would start registering voters on Sept. 14 and would end the process on Jan. 15. Opposition parties have been demanding a new roll for voters and have previously accused Mugabe s ruling ZANU-PF party of manipulating the existing register. ZANU-PF denies these accusations. Mugabe also told the central committee of his ZANU-PF on Friday that his party should galvanize supporters to register anew.  He said Western powers were behind the last month s reunification of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change but added that the opposition would still be defeated by ZANU-PF in next year s votes.  We know of course they are creatures of the West whose sole purpose is to dislodge ZANU-PF from power. But really, they come together as a bundle then one blow against a bundle will set the bundle in pieces,  Mugabe said to applause from ZANU-PF members. ",0
43162,U.S. judges limit Trump immigration order; some officials ignore rulings,"(Reuters) - U.S. judges in at least five states blocked federal authorities from enforcing President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. However, lawyers representing people covered by the order said some authorities were unwilling on Sunday to follow the judges’ rulings. Judges in California, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington state, each home to international airports, issued their rulings after a similar order was issued on Saturday night by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York’s Brooklyn borough. Donnelly had ruled in a lawsuit by two men from Iraq being held at John F. Kennedy International Airport. While none of the rulings struck down Friday’s executive order by the new Republican president, the growing number of them could complicate the administration’s effort to enforce it. The rulings add to questions about the constitutionality of the order, said Andrew Pincus, a Mayer Brown partner representing two Yemeni men who were denied U.S. entry from an overseas flight despite being legal permanent residents. “People have gone through processes to obtain legal permanent resident status, or visas,” Pincus said. “There are serious questions about whether those rights, which were created by statute, can be unilaterally taken away without process.” Trump’s order halted travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and stopped the resettlement of refugees for 120 days. He said these actions were needed “to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.” The order sparked a global backlash, including from U.S. allies that view the actions as discriminatory and divisive. Attorneys general from California, New York, 13 other states and Washington, D.C., meanwhile, in a statement condemned and pledged to fight what they called Trump’s “dangerous” and “unconstitutional” order. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Sunday said it “will comply with judicial orders,” while enforcing Trump’s order in a manner that ensures those entering the United States “do not pose a threat to our country or the American people.” Striking that balance has caused confusion, according to lawyers who worked overnight and on Sunday to help travelers at JFK Airport, Washington Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia, and elsewhere. Immigration lawyer Sharifa Abbasi said some Border Patrol agents at Dulles refused to let lawyers talk with detainees, even after being shown an order from U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema requiring such access. Abbasi said the agents instead told the lawyers to call their agency’s office, where no one was answering. “There is really no method to this madness,” Becca Heller, director of the New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project organization, told reporters on a conference call. Supporters of Trump’s order said authorities acted properly in swiftly taking steps to enforce it.  “It is better (to) be safe than sorry,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies in Washington. Lawsuits on behalf of more than 100 individual travelers have been filed nationwide, activists and lawyers estimated. Some have come from large corporate firms including Mayer Brown, Kirkland & Ellis, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. In Boston, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs on Sunday temporarily blocked the removal of two Iranians who have taught at the University of Massachusetts, and had been detained at the city’s Logan International Airport. Burroughs’ ruling appeared to go further than Donnelly’s by barring the detention, as well as the removal, of approved refugees, visa holders and permanent U.S. residents entering from the seven countries. Donnelly’s order forbade only removal. Matthew Segal, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, in a statement called Burroughs’ ruling “a huge victory for justice” in the face of what he called Trump’s “unconstitutional ban on Muslims.” The U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion. Trump’s order sought to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, which the president said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. Burroughs’ ruling also prompted some Trump critics to urge holders of green cards, which allow foreign nationals to live and work permanently in the United States, to fly into Boston, to lessen the risk of detainment. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said several times on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Trump’s order does not affect green card holders “moving forward” or “going forward.” In a ruling on Sunday, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles directed the return to the United States of Ali Khoshbakhti Vayeghan, who authorities had sent back to his native Iran following Trump’s order.  The ruling from Brinkema, in Alexandria, Virginia, barred the Homeland Security agency from removing an estimated 50 to 60 legal permanent residents who had been detained at Dulles. In Seattle, U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly barred the government from removing two people, who were not named in court papers. He scheduled a Feb. 3 hearing on whether to lift that stay. ",0
33901,WHEN DID ROMNEY BECOME The Godfather Of The GOP…And Why Didn’t He Fight This Hard Against Obama? [VIDEO],"It s difficult to look at Romney coming out against Trump and not wonder if there are a few  sour grapes?   Romney s timing for questioning Trump s character is very interesting, considering his former deputy campaign manager, Katie Packer was the key figure behind the anti-Trump super-PAC,  Our Principles created for the sole purpose of taking down Trump that just announced yesterday that they ve given up on their efforts. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney stated that Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Texas Senator Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Florida Senator Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) ought to release their taxes for  the last two years that have already been filed  and that there s  good reason to believe that there s a bombshell in Donald Trump s taxes  on Wednesday s  Your World with Neil Cavuto  on the Fox News Channel.He added,  I think there s no question but that Donald Trump has the clearest path to become the Republican nominee. I think for the other people still in the race, their path is becoming a slimmer and slimmer opening, and they re having a difficult time communicating to their supporters just how they could become the nominee. It s not impossible. I think it s very difficult for any one of the non-Donald Trump contenders to be able to be a real threat, unless perhaps the field narrows.Romney then said, when asked about his lack of an endorsement for anyone so far,  Well, frankly, I d like to see a number of things from the candidates, not just their positions on issues in some detail, and some candidates are more thorough in laying out what they re going to do than others, but I d also like to see their back taxes. I d like to see where they filed their taxes in the last several years. I m not talking about their taxes this year. I m talking about the taxes that have already been filed with the IRS. And Donald Trump and Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have [not] shown us their back taxes. Romney further stated that  the last two years that have already been filed  would  give us a real sense of whether these people are on the up and up, and whether they ve been telling us things about themselves that are true or not.  He then said,  I think we have good reason to believe that there s a bombshell in Donald Trump s taxes. He explained,  I think there s something there, either he s not as anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is, or he hasn t been paying the kind of taxes we would expect him to pay, or perhaps he hasn t been giving money to the vets, or to the disabled, like he s been telling us he s been doing. And I think that s   the reason that I think there s a bombshell in there, is because every time he s asked about his taxes, he dodges and delays and says, well, we re working on it. Hey, we re not talking about the taxes that are coming due this year. Of course they re working on those. They won t be ready for months. We re talking about taxes already filed, back taxes. And my back taxes, when I ran in 2012, my back taxes, I put out in January of 2012. We re now in late February and we still haven t seen either Donald Trump s, or Marco Rubio s, or Ted Cruz s taxes. And frankly the voters have a right to see those tax returns before they decide who our nominee ought to be. Trump s response to Romney s accusation:Romney said that the scrutiny over his taxes when he ran back in 2012 is  a good reason for getting these things out before the voters make their choices to who our nominee will be.  He continued,  I put my taxes out in January of 2012, and that gave people a chance to digest it, and decide whether I was going to be the nominee or not. And if in fact Donald Trump s taxes, or Marco Rubio s, or Ted Cruz s, have some real problems in there, let s get them out there and see them. But I think it s pretty clear that, given Donald Trump s dodging and weaving and delay, I think the last time he was asked about his taxes he said, well, it s going to be a month. Look, people have a right to know if there s a problem in those taxes before they decide. Romney concluded,  You know, Donald Trump has said he s the best in the country for the disabled veterans, and for the disabled generally. Well, if his taxes show that he hasn t made any contributions to the disabled veterans, or to the disabled generally, that would be a big issue. So   and I m not saying that s the case. I have no evidence of that. But I m just saying there are things that could be issues, and when people decide they don t want to give you their taxes, it s usually because there s something they don t want you to see. Via:BreitbartPosted by Donald J. Trump on Thursday, 25 February 2016 Does Romney s concern over Trump and his taxes have anything to do with Trump s go it alone attitude? Or perhaps The Donald has a point?.@MittRomney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible ""choke"" loss to Obama!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2015Mitt Romney, the failed 2012 Republican presidential nominee who, alongside running mate Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), lost the election to President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, is lecturing 2016 GOP frontrunner Donald Trump on how a Republican can win the White House. I think Donald Trump has said a number of things which are hurtful, and he has said they were childish in some respects, and I think will be potentially problematic either in a primary or in a general election if he were to become the nominee,  Romney said in a rare interview granted to former Obama strategist David Axelrod, according to The Hill newspaper.Romney added that he thinks Trump will  have some challenges if he proceeds to the next stage  and that he thinks  to a degree  Trump s comments and style  do  hurt the GOP as a whole.While Romney previously predicted that Trump won t win the nomination, his change of tone in this Axelrod interview seems to indicate he s now entertaining the possibility of a nominee Donald Trump.Romney lost the election in 2012 after winning the nomination against a fairly weak GOP primary field. He also lost in 2008, failing to win the nomination against Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). Like Romney would four years later, McCain lost the 2008 presidential election to Obama. Even though Romney has lost every presidential election in which he s ever competed, some Republicans still gravitate to him and his inner circle for political advice.Earlier this cycle, Romney met with several candidates, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) the two leading establishment candidates vying for the nomination in New Hampshire. In the interview with Axelrod, Romney spoke very highly of both Rubio and Bush.In August 2012 during the heat of Romney s presidential race with President Barack Obama, then-Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV)2% charged Romney hadn t pay taxes for 10 years.Shortly after Reid made those allegations, Trump defended Romney in an interview with Fox News Channel s Greta Van Susteren on the August, 7, 2012 broadcast of  On the Record. I think it s a very strong statement that Harry made,  Trump said.  And I ve known Harry and I like Harry. But I think it s a statement that he probably wished he didn t make. I don t think there was a source. A lot of people don t think there was a source. If there was a source, it s probably not allowed and it s probably not even legal. I mean, who would be able to do that? Who would be allowed to do that? I don t think there is a source. WATCH Donald Trump defend Romney s alleged tax issues with Greta Susteren at the 3:10 mark:",1
25368, Store Owner Where Alton Sterling Was Killed Suing Baton Rouge Police,"The plot is definitely thickening when it comes to the horrific death of an African-American man at the hands of two white police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Abdullah Muflahi owns the Triple S Food Mart, where the events of that fateful night took place. Now, he has filed a lawsuit against the police. The suit alleges that in the aftermath of the murder of Alton Sterling, whom Muflahi allowed to sell his CD s out front of the store, Muflahi was taken into custody like a common criminal, where the cops took his cell phone, along with surveillance video of the shooting. All of this was done without a warrant, which is definitely illegal, and reeks of a cover-up. The suit says of what happened: At all times defendants knew that plaintiff Muflahi was only a witness to the events at his store and that being a witness did not entitle police to hold plaintiff in custody or seize or commandeer his store and store equipment. Of course, the cops are not talking about these new developments. Muflahi is suing the cops who shot Sterling, as well as the city of Baton Rouge itself. Also named in the lawsuit are the investigating officers and the Baton Rouge police chief. There was no warrant for any of the store s surveillance footage until roughly five hours after the cops murdered Alton Sterling, so they had no right to immediately take that footage, and at no point should Abdullah Muflahi been taken into custody for any reason. He was a witness to a crime committed by the Baton Rouge police. He is not the criminal here.The document that requested the warrant claimed that Sterling did not put his hands on the hood of a car when he was told to do so, and therefore tasers were used. They saw what they believed to be a gun sticking out of Sterling s pocket, and therefore they tased him. Now, anyone with knowledge of tasers knows that they incapacitate the average person pretty well. There was no need to shoot and kill him, but of course the cops claim otherwise: When the subject attempted to reach for the gun from his pocket, the officers fired their police-issued duty weapon at the subject to stop the threat. I d be willing to bet they erased what footage they could, along with any video on the cell phone they unlawfully took from Abdullah Muflahi. It will be just as doctored as the stories they are telling regarding the shooting itself. This is nothing more than the police doing their damndest to keep their murderous brothers in blue out of an indictment and possible prison time.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images",1
3801,BRICS Countries to Invest $500 Million in Russian Gold Deposit - Kira Egorova,"Taming the corporate media beast BRICS Countries to Invest $500 Million in Russian Gold Deposit 
A new agreement to restart exploration and extraction at a mine in Siberia marks a milestone in the development of economic ties among the BRICS nations. Originally appeared at RBTH 
A consortium made up of the Chinese state-owned mining firm China National Gold Corporation, India’s SUN Mining Group and the Russian Far East Development Fund, as well as funds from South Africa and Brazil is prepared to invest up to $500 million in the development of the Klyuchevskoye gold field in the Transbaikal region (over 4,000 miles east of Moscow). The agreement was signed during the most recent BRICS summit, which that took place in the Indian resort of Goa on Oct. 15-16. According to plans for the site, Klyuchevskoye will become operational three years after investment becomes available and will yield some 6.5 tons of gold per year. 
This is the first mining deal in the history of BRICS that involves all five member states, which makes it particularly significant, says Wiktor Bielski, global head of commodities research at VTB Capital. Bielski adds that the agreement paves the way for bigger projects in the future that can benefit a wide range of BRICS investors. 
Benefits for the partners 
The Klyuchevskoye gold deposit was explored a long time ago, however, the bulk of the gold was not extracted because of the costly development process that was halted some 20 years back, according to Alexei Kalachev, an expert analyst with FINAM investment firm in Moscow. The China National Gold Corporation, however, has the relevant technological experience to extract and process the gold, Kalachev said. 
The deposit is currently owned by India’s SUN Gold, Ltd., part of the SUN Mining Group, which has not begun to develop it. In August 2016, the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service said that the China National Gold Group intended to buy 70 percent in the deposit from SUN Gold. According to Kalachev, the idea of a consortium may have evolved from an attempt to speed up the deal at the highest levels. 
The Klyuchevskoye gold deposit is not especially rich; at its stated production volumes and reserves, it will have a life cycle of 11-12 years, while the average life cycle of gold mines worldwide is 15-16 years, says Artem Kalinin, a portfolio manager at Leon Family Office. Additionally, the cost of production at Klyuchevskoye is being forecast at the average global level. “That said, the Chinese are used to operating in this mode: the country’s steel and coal industries have very weak production costs, but they have so far been feeling quite alright thanks to cheap financing and state support,” Kalinin said. 
Russian gold mining companies are currently not taking part in developing Klyuchevskoye, but according to Kalinin, Russia stands to gain regardless of who develops the site. “The Russians will get an opportunity to borrow new technologies and to get an infrastructure that the Chinese will build,” he said. 
Alexei Kalachev notes that other obvious upsides for Russia include a rise in tax revenues, new jobs and an inflow of foreign investment. 
What’s in it for China? 
Despite the fact that China is the world’s leader in gold mining and one of the world’s largest consumers of the precious metal, its resource base is rather weak, says Kalinin. The CIS countries host the majority of the world’s gold reserves — 28 percent. Another 20 percent of the reserves are located in North America while Asian reserves make up just 11 percent. 
Oleg Remyga, head of China studies at the Moscow School of Management Skolkovo, notes that China’s gold production is falling — it was down 0.4 percent in 2015 — while consumption is rising — up + 3.7 percent in 2015. “Hence, the clear ambition of Chinese companies to enter international markets,” Remyga explained. 
According to Remyga, the China National Gold Group’s investment in the Klyuchevskoye deposit is part of this bigger drive for resources. Chinese companies have already purchased shares in Canada’s Pinnacle Mines, Ltd. as well as 50 percent of shares in a deposit in Papua New Guinea owned by Barrick Gold Corp. “I am convinced that it is just the beginning of acquisitions of Russian gold-mining assets by Chinese companies, such as Zijin Mining, China Gold, Zhaojin Mining Industry, and Shandong Gold,” Remyga said, adding that negotiations with them have been going on already for five years.",1

The “modern day marvel.” The machines are taking over The candidates in the current campaign – or any campaign – are all promising to “bring back good jobs” to “create good jobs.” When asked how they would do that, they are all a little light on details.About a year ago, Joe Biden was in Michigan to celebrate the opening of a new manufacturing plant that made “small metal clamps” used in all kinds of industries to hold wiring, hoses. Etc. in place. The largest market is the auto industry but they are sold to hundreds of other manufacturers. Depending on size, shape, and material, these parts sell for a few pennies or less. You have to make a lot of these parts to have any substantial billing numbers.This new plant is fully automated and runs 24/7/365 with just 14 people. Joe was quite happy saying “manufacturing is returning to America.”However, there is a backstory. That plant had been around for years. It had employed 600 people on two shifts. Then, the Chinese began to undercut the pricing, and the plant was no longer profitable and closed. Two years later, it reopened as a fully automated plant and regained the business because it could now manufacture cheaper than the Chinese.There are several stories inside the main story.The first story is about the initial plant closing. Anytime 600 people lose their jobs, you know that some employee ended up losing their home, that some cars were reprocessed, that some college kid had to quit school, etc. Retailers got hit.

55712,Tunisia rescues 140 migrants off its coast,"TUNIS (Reuters) - The Tunisian navy rescued 98 Tunisians fleeing to Europe when their boat started to sink off Kerkenah on the southeast coast late on Saturday, the national guard said.  Separately, the army said it had arrested 43 illegal migrants rescued from four boats off Zarzis, also on the southeast coast. Tunisia has been praised for its democratic progress after a 2011 uprising against autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali but successive governments have failed to create jobs for young people, some of whom head illegally to Europe to seek work. Tunisia arrested about 550 Tunisian and African migrants trying to sail to Europe in September, against only 170 in August, official data showed on Thursday. Human traffickers increasingly use Tunisia as a launch pad for migrants heading for Europe as Libya s coast guard, aided by armed groups, has tightened controls.  The water leaked to a boat carrying 98 migrants, when it was sinking, but the naval guard rescued them off the coast of Kerkenah,  Colonel Major Khelifa Chibani of Tunisia s national guard said. ",0
22182, Trump Camp Adviser Drops STUNNING Revelation – Here’s Why The RNC Suddenly Went Pro-Russia,"The evidence that Russia is buying us up continues to mount, and the pile is so tall it s about to tip over. While Trump is busy accusing Chuck Schumer of being a hypocrite because he s met with Russia too (a thing he openly admits and has never lied about or covered up, which is the issue with Trump s people), one of his campaign advisers, J.D. Gordon, has decided to reverse course on his statements about why the RNC reversed its course on Russia and inserted pro-Russian language to its platform.Now he s saying this: [I, along with others] advocated for the GOP platform to include language against arming Ukrainians against pro-Russian rebels because this was in line with Trump s views, expressed at a March national security meeting at the unfinished Trump hotel [in Washington, D.C.]  [emphasis mine]Apparently, Trump didn t want to start WWIII over Ukraine (but he s perfectly willing to start it on Twitter with China, Mexico, and all of NATO).Gordon says that Trump believed helping get Russia out of Ukraine was anathema to  improved relations with Russia.  The problem with  improved relations with Russia  is that Trump doesn t want that for world peace and unity. He wants it because he s in bed with Putin, along with Jared Kushner, Jeff Sessions, and disgraced security adviser Michael Flynn.Sessions actually presided over the meeting where that plank of the platform was changed. Look impossibly suspicious yet? It should. To make Trump s growing ties to Russia even more crystal clear here, the week that this went down was also the week that Wikileaks released thousands of emails that Russia had obtained via its hacks.Seriously, can we impeach Trump now? The time for that started the day he was inaugurated. We have an entire administration selling us out to one of our biggest enemies, and an entire political party that won t do a thing about it, likely because it will make them look as corrupt as they are.Featured image by John Moore via Getty Images",1
53857,Kenya to charge opposition leader's sister with incitement to violence,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan authorities will arrest and charge the sister of opposition leader Raila Odinga with incitement to violence after attacks on the election board, the chief prosecutor s office said on Monday. Odinga has pulled out of the re-run of an election he was due to contest on Thursday against President Uhuru Kenyatta, saying problems with the election board meant the vote would not be fair. He has called for protests and a boycott and on Sunday said on Twitter there would be  no election .  We resume our picketing at IEBC (election board) offices countrywide on Tuesday and Wednesday. We maintain that there will be no election on Thursday,  he said, without giving details. Kenya is East Africa s richest economy and a trade and transport gateway as well as a hub for diplomacy and security, so its stability is considered vital for the region. Odinga s supporters disrupted a training session for election officials last week in the western city of Kisumu, which is his political stronghold. They attacked election staff and destroyed tents and polling material, witnesses said. Ruth Odinga, who is the opposition leader s sister and a former deputy governor of Kisumu county, was present at the protest, according to Reuters witnesses. Prosecutors instructed police to arrest her, opposition Senator Fred Outa and others. She will be charged with incitement, destruction of property, obstructing election officers and trespassing in an electoral center, according to a letter that the director of public prosecution s office posted online.   The suspects should immediately be charged,  the letter said. Neither Ruth Odinga nor Outa could immediately be contacted for comment. The arrests could anger Odinga s supporters and escalate tension over an election season that has divided the country and led to the deaths of at least 37 people since the first election was held on Aug. 8 including four in the last two weeks. Odinga says the election board had made insufficient reforms to prevent a repeat of the same mistakes that marred the previous presidential polls on Aug. 8. Kenyatta won that election but the Supreme Court last nullified the result, saying there had been procedural irregularities and a repeat must be held. The election board and Kenyatta say the poll will be held regardless of whether Odinga participates. ",0

56810,Actress goes solo to push for end to Philippines drug war,"MANILA (Reuters) - Mae Paner is a policeman-turned-assassin, a widowed Zumba dancer, a photojournalist and an orphaned child. They are all characters in her new one-woman show against a bloody war on drugs in the Philippines. Paner, better known by her stage name  Juana Change , said she wanted to add her voice to the condemnation of President Rodrigo Duterte s fierce 15-month-old campaign which has killed thousands of people.  I feel very strongly that we have our work cut out for us as artists to wake people up, to wake our president up, and to tell him that we are against his war on drugs,  Paner told Reuters Television. Paner portrays four characters who are affected by the drugs war, from the assassin grappling with his guilt and the journalist scarred by images of the nightly carnage, to widows and orphans crying out for justice. Filipinos remain largely supportive of the campaign as a solution to tackling rampant crime, which Duterte says stems mostly from drug addiction. Human rights groups, the Catholic Church and opposition lawmakers have raised alarm about the killings that have focused largely on the urban poor and have not spared young people. More than 3,800 people have been killed in police anti-drugs operations in the past 15 months and at least 2,100 other homicides were likely drug related.  Police reject allegations by human rights groups that they are executing suspected users and dealers. Some audience members who watched a recent performance of Paner s play said they hoped it would prompt Filipinos to ask questions about the drugs war.  The more this play is staged - wherever it may be shown, wherever more people can watch it - the more people can think and have much more informed opinions on this matter,  said Pastor Kakai Pamaran.

17289,President Obama Weighs His Economic Legacy - The New York Times,"Two months ago, across an   table in a factory in Jacksonville, Fla. President Barack Obama was talking to me about the problem of political capital. His efforts to rebuild the U. S. economy from the 2008 financial crisis were being hit from left, right and center. And yet, by his own assessment, those efforts were vastly underappreciated. “I actually compare our economic performance to how, historically, countries that have wrenching financial crises perform,” he said. “By that measure, we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history. ” It was a notably grand claim, especially given the tenor in which presidential candidates of both parties had taken to criticizing the state of the American economy  —   “Many are still barely getting by,” Hillary Clinton said, while Donald Trump said that “we’re a   nation. ” Asked if he was frustrated by all the criticism, Obama insisted that he wasn’t, at least not personally. “It has frustrated me only insofar as it has shaped the political debate,” he said. “We were moving so fast early on that we couldn’t take victory laps. We couldn’t explain everything we were doing. I mean, one day we’re saving the banks the next day we’re saving the auto industry the next day we’re trying to see whether we can have some impact on the housing market. ” The result, he said, was that he lacked the political capital to do more. As his presidency nears its end, this has become an increasingly common refrain from Obama, who, despite his prodigious skills as an orator, has come to seem more confident about his achievements than about his ability to promote them. “I mean, the truth of the matter is that if we had been able to more effectively communicate all the steps we had taken to the swing voter,” he said, “then we might have maintained a majority in the House or the Senate. ” The president had come to this factory, built by Saft America for the manufacture of       batteries, for a kind of belated victory lap. One of Obama’s first major acts as president was to sign the American Recovery and Re investment Act, and some of the money in that bill went to Saft. Now batteries were rolling off the line, and Obama had stopped by to shine the national spotlight on how far we had come since the financial crisis. But the president did seem frustrated. As he tried to sum up his economic legacy in Florida, our discussion stretched to twice as long as planned, seemingly to the consternation of the Secret Service. When we got back on Air Force One, he sent an aide to ask if we could continue the conversation when I joined him again, he looked as if he’d been stewing over something. He quickly returned to the topic of public perception. “If you ask the average person on the streets, ‘Have deficits gone down or up under Obama?’ probably 70 percent would say they’ve gone up,” Obama said, with some justifiable exasperation  —   the deficit has in fact declined (by roughly  ) since he took office, and polls do show that a large majority of Americans believe the opposite. Obama is animated by a sense that, looking at the world around him, the U. S. economy is in much better shape than the public appreciates, especially when measured against the depths of the financial crisis and the possibility  —   now rarely even considered  —   that things could have been much, much worse. Over a series of conversations in the Oval Office, on Air Force One and in Florida, Obama analyzed, sometimes with startling frankness, nearly every element of his economic agenda since he came into office. His economy has certainly come further than most people recognize. The private sector has added jobs for 73 consecutive months  —   some 14. 4 million new jobs in all  —   the longest period of sustained job growth on record. Unemployment, which peaked at 10 percent the year Obama took office, the highest it had been since 1983, under Ronald Reagan, is now 5 percent, lower than when Reagan left office. The budget deficit has fallen by roughly $1 trillion during his two terms. And overall U. S. economic growth has significantly outpaced that of every other advanced nation. Gene Sperling, the former director of the National Economic Council who spent hours inside the Oval Office debating and devising the president’s economic strategy, told me, “If we were back in early 2009  —   when we were coming to work every morning with clenched stomachs, with the economy losing 800, 000 jobs a month and the Dow under 7, 000  —   and someone said that by your last year in office, unemployment would be 5 percent, the deficit would be under 3 percent, AIG would have turned a profit and we made all our money back on the banks, that would’ve been beyond anybody’s wildest expectations. ” There are, of course, many reasons so few Americans seem to be celebrating. “How people feel about the economy,” Obama told me, giving one part of his own theory, is influenced by “what they hear. ” He went on: “And if you have a political party  —   in this case, the Republicans  —   that denies any progress and is constantly channeling to their base, which is sizable, say, 40 percent of the population, that things are terrible all the time, then people will start absorbing that. ” But as Obama also acknowledged, the public anger about the economy is not without empirical basis. A large swath of the nation has dropped out of the labor force completely, and the reality for the average American family is that its household income is $4, 000 less than it was when Bill Clinton left office. Economic inequality, meanwhile, has only grown worse, with the top 1 percent of American households taking in more than half of the recent gains in income growth. “Millions and millions and millions and millions of people look at that pretty picture of America he painted and they cannot find themselves in it to save their lives,” Clinton himself said of Obama’s economy in March, while on the campaign trail for his wife. “People are upset, frankly they’re   they’re disoriented, because they don’t see themselves in that picture. ” It is this disconnect that haunts Obama. He has, by his own lights, managed the recovery as well as any president ever could, with results that in many cases exceeded his own best hopes. But despite the gains of the past seven years, many Americans have been left behind. Something has changed, and as he prepares to leave office, Obama seems to understand that his economic legacy might be judged not just by what he has done, but by how the results compare to a bygone era of   opportunity, one that perhaps no president, faced with the sweeping changes transforming the global economy, could ever bring back. The economic meltdown that would define every aspect of Obama’s economy came to a head well before he became president, of course, and so did the legislation that would be the basis for everything that came after. In September 2008  —   as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and AIG, the world’s biggest insurance company, accepted a federal bailout  —   Senator John McCain of Arizona, in what was widely viewed as a political move, suspended his presidential campaign and called on Obama to rush back to Washington for a bipartisan meeting at the White House. Obama recalled the moment: “I still remember Bush calling me and saying, ‘Look, I doubt this is going to be particularly useful, but I felt obliged to say yes, and I hope you can come. ’’u2009” The next day Obama found himself in the Cabinet Room just down the hall from the Oval Office, along with McCain and congressional leaders from both parties. Henry M. Paulson Jr. the Treasury secretary, was developing a bank bailout by which the Treasury would buy up to $700 billion in shaky   securities  —   “troubled assets”  —   a plan that eventually became the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. He needed votes, and Republicans weren’t going for it. Nobody wanted to be seen as a friend of the banks. “We’re sitting around a table, McCain is on one side, I’m on the other, Bernanke and Paulson and President Bush,” Obama recalled. “Paulson says, ‘If we don’t take action now, we could go into a free fall.’ And given how bad the politics were, it was still very tempting for Nancy and Harry”  —   that is, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid  —   “to let the Republicans do what they needed to do. ” Many within Bush’s own party were supporting an alternative bill that was focused on   asset insurance and tax cuts. But Obama, convinced that anything short of a major bailout could lead to economic catastrophe, said Democrats should back Paulson’s plan. They did. It was a rare moment of bipartisanship, with   political consequences. To Obama, this was a necessary alliance with Wall Street and a Republican president. To many others, it looked like a sweetheart deal for the same people who created the mess some critics wondered why he was not equally quick to help aggrieved homeowners through an aggressive   or forgiveness program. “The whole thing about financial crises is the tools that work are the ones that will make you look like you’re in bed with the banks,” said Timothy Geithner, an architect of TARP whom Obama made his Treasury secretary. The strange   relationship with Wall Street made the next part of Obama’s program extremely complicated. When Obama took office, he turned immediately to trying to pass a stimulus package. If TARP was meant to keep the economy out of free fall, the stimulus was meant to help it get back into good shape. The crucial questions was: How much money was needed? Many argue today that Obama’s $800 billion plan, the one that eventually became law, was not enough. With a bigger boost, the economy would have recovered much more quickly and years of needless suffering could have been allayed. In truth, of course, the political headwinds against stimulus were extraordinary. Republicans dismissed it as an irresponsible shopping spree that would leave the country in even greater debt. Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the minority leader in the House, physically threw the bill on the ground, arguing that it was “nothing more than spending, spending and more spending. ” But Democrats, led by the “deficit hawk” wing of the party, also fought against anything too ambitious, and Obama, still in the first month of his presidency, was left in the position of negotiating with his own party, such that he was just barely able to get the $800 billion on a straight   vote. At first, the results of the stimulus were just as feeble as a stalwart Keynesian might predict. The economy needed a big injection, but it got only a   one, so it continued to falter. A January 2009 report from the president’s Council of Economic Advisers projected that the stimulus would keep unemployment below 8 percent. Instead, it climbed to 10 percent in 2009 and only fell back below 8 percent in 2012, leading to criticism that the stimulus was ineffective. Obama’s critics regularly trot out the talking point that Obama’s economy is “the worst recovery since World War II. ” Judged solely by the growth of gross domestic product, that is accurate. But Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economics professor and   of “This Time Is Different,” a   history of financial crises, scoffed when I mentioned the “worst recovery” epithet. “Well, have we had a systemic financial crisis since World War II?” he asked rhetorically. “I mean this was like nothing we’ve experienced since World War II. The 1982 Volcker recession was nothing compared to this, and so you have to look at the nature of the shock. ” Obama, though, was unable or unwilling to rhetorically underscore the severity of the crisis as it unfolded, so perhaps what should have been seen as successes were seen as failures. “It was a delicate balance throughout 2009 and 2010 to be straight with the American people about the depths of the problem, how close we were to disaster, without scaring the heck out of them,” Obama said. Beyond the messaging challenge, Obama faced a practical bind as well: Just as he was trying to reinflate the economy, he was also being forced to cut government jobs, under pressure from Republicans who contended that government bloat and the cost of it could create our next financial crisis. Call it an  . “This is the first recovery where you actually saw the government work force decline, and that created this massive fiscal drag throughout the recovery,” Obama said. Despite all this, over the course of his presidency, Obama has actually been able to oversee a much larger stimulus than has been typically reported. If you add up all of his administration’s classic stimulus measures, including the many tax breaks the administration extended, you get $1. 4 trillion, a figure that is nearly twice the original figure. The   then, was counteracted by a stealth stimulus. “Progressives don’t fully appreciate the degree to which the 2011 budget deal not only averted a potential default but actually limited the potential damage of a newly emboldened Congress in imposing austerity on a   recovery,” Obama said. “And by me winning in 2012 and getting the Bush tax cuts for the upper 2 percent repealed, we ended up getting a grand bargain. It’s just we got it sequentially instead of all at once. ” When I asked Barney Frank about how history will judge the recovery, he was simultaneously rueful and amused. As chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Frank was one of the major legislative architects of Obama’s economic program. “You get no credit for disaster averted or damage minimized,” Frank said. By way of illustration, he described a bumper sticker that a friend made him in 2010, with a slogan that could have worked just as well for Obama: “Things would have sucked worse without me. ” Frank, with a halfhearted laugh, added, “That’s not a very salable message. ” Often in our conversations, the president expressed a surprising degree of identification with America’s business leaders. “If I hadn’t gone into politics and public service,” Obama told me, “the challenges of creating a business and growing a business and making it work would probably be the thing that was most interesting to me. ” His showy embrace of capitalism was especially notable given his fractious relationship with Wall Street and the business community for much of his first term. In December 2009, Obama was not reluctant to chastise bankers. “I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of   bankers on Wall Street,” he told Steve Kroft on “60 Minutes. ” “The people on Wall Street still don’t get it. They don’t get it. They’re still puzzled, ‘Why is it that people are mad at the banks? ’’u2009” Given the national mood at the time, Obama’s words shouldn’t have come as a surprise to the business leaders. But the financial sector had buoyed Obama’s campaign, giving him $16 million in political support, nearly twice what McCain received from it, and some executives responded to his new populism in emotional terms. “It’s a war,” Stephen Schwarzman, a   of Blackstone Group, the giant   firm, said of Obama in 2010 and his effort to close a tax loophole that benefited the industry. “It’s like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. ” (Schwarzman later apologized.) Others seemed more concerned with the language itself. In 2011, Leon Cooperman, a billionaire   manager, wrote a public letter to Obama, saying: “The divisive, polarizing tone of your rhetoric is cleaving a widening gulf, at this point as much visceral as philosophical, between the downtrodden and those best positioned to help them. It is a gulf that is at once counterproductive and freighted with dangerous historical precedents. ” When I asked him about these reactions, Obama laughed. The criticism he leveled at Wall Street “was extraordinarily mild,” he said, but “it hurt their feelings. I would have some of them say to me, ‘You know, my son came home and asked me, ‘Am I a fat cat? ’’u2009” He laughed again. Obama’s rhetoric does seem mild, at least compared with the withering contempt of, say, Franklin Roosevelt, who, laying out the objectives for the second stage of the New Deal in 1936, said that reckless bankers and speculators are “unanimous in their hate for me  —   and I welcome their hatred. ” Obama, to the contrary, seems to find their hatred irritating. “One of the constants that I’ve had to deal with over the last few years is folks on Wall Street complaining even as the stock market went from in the 6, 000s to 16, 000 or 17, 000,” he said. “They’d be constantly complaining about our economic policies. That’s not rooted in anything they’re experiencing it has to do with ideology and their aggravations about higher taxes. ” Wall Street’s biggest fight with Obama was over the   Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which Obama signed into law in the summer of 2010. The legislation, which runs to 2, 223 pages, limited Wall Street’s riskiest trading schemes, established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and created a system to wind down failing banks without   bailouts and break up banks that don’t comply. Like the stimulus,   has been seen as both going too far and not far enough. Some economists have suggested that the reform package, combined with the Federal Reserve’s efforts to force the banks to hold more capital, most likely slowed lending and potentially economic growth in the short term. The new rules may have been sensible in the aftermath of the crisis, but they did take an economic toll. “Growth requires access to capital to finance investments in plant, equipment, technology, and workers,” said Douglas   a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who now runs American Action Forum, a   research group. “  made capital scarcer and more expensive at a time when the weak economy desperately needed a boost to growth. ”   estimated in 2015 that the regulations would shave $895 billion off gross domestic product over the next decade. Obama sees the legislation in more complicated terms. He said that he liked the film “The Big Short”  —   a vivid portrayal of the 2008 crisis with a special emphasis on the avarice of its main architects  —   but not its ending. It suggests, wrongly, he said, that nothing has changed on Wall Street. The financial sector “is bigger, absorbs more resources and maybe most importantly, more talent than I would like to see. I would like folks who are really good at math to be going into engineering and the sciences more than they’re going into trying to build algorithms to beat the market and to work arbitrage,” he said. “But there is no doubt that the financial system is substantially more stable,” he said. “It is true that we have not dismantled the financial system, and in that sense, Bernie Sanders’s critique is correct”  —   a reference to the Vermont senator and presidential aspirant who regularly calls to break up America’s biggest banks. “But one of the things that I’ve consistently tried to remind myself during the course of my presidency is that the economy is not an abstraction. It’s not something that you can just redesign and break up and put back together again without consequences. ” The Saft America plant, a giant    mass of concrete, is a modern marvel: its roof covered in row upon row of solar panels, embodying the renewable future that the batteries manufactured within are meant to sustain. (The main customer for the batteries was originally meant to be   manufacturers, but the company is now selling mostly to utilities who want to store solar and wind energy.) Obama spoke from a makeshift stage set up at the center of the factory floor, an American flag and a Saft logo perfectly positioned behind him to catch the sight lines of the photographers. “The reason I’m here today is because Saft is telling a story about the amazing work that people all across this country have done to bring America back from one of the worst financial crises in our history,” Obama said, surveying the crowd. He added: “Anybody who says we are not absolutely better off today than we were just seven years ago, they’re not leveling with you. They’re not telling the truth. ” The story Obama told was one of American ingenuity and growth since the financial crisis. Unemployment in Florida peaked at 11. 2 percent in 2009, higher than the national average, and the state was a center for home foreclosures. Saft America was an example not of the government’s effort just to reduce unemployment right now, which it has, but also to spur investment in the   green technologies, like   batteries, that will help the economy expand for decades to come. In a way, though, the plant was inadvertently telling a more complicated story, about globalization and the changing nature of commerce. Saft America is a unit of Saft Groupe, a French company with holdings around the world. Sales of   batteries have been considerably slower than anticipated, and the factory has yet to turn a profit. The French parent doesn’t expect profitability for another two or three years and has already written down part of its investment on the factory. Here was a factory built, in part, with U. S. government dollars for the benefit of the local and national economy. Yet the factory, its technology and its patents are all owned by a foreign corporation. Its French chief executive is almost completely detached from the community here in Jacksonville he did not even attend Obama’s speech. And the factory’s profits, to the extent they ever come, may very well be sent abroad instead of being reinvested here. The factory visit might also tell a more complicated story about the presidency. It has always been the case that voters credit or, more often, blame the president for the nation’s economic performance. But it is also the case that the president generally has considerably less sway to move the economy than even he might like to acknowledge. And as the economy continues to disperse, that sway may be diminishing further. A president has less power than ever, in either a   power ( ) or   (cultural) sense, over American chief executives, let alone over the chief executives of multinationals based in France or China or other places where many U. S. employers make their headquarters. In the assembly room after the speech, Obama acknowledged as much. “When you’re talking about inversions,” Obama said, referring to the practice whereby American companies effectively move overseas, “or you’re talking about C. E. O. perks or the gap between what the   worker is making compared to what the C. E. O. is making, all those things used to be constrained by the fact that you live in the city, you’re going to church in that city, your kids might be going to the same school as the guy who is working on the assembly line because public schools actually were invested in,” Obama said. “And all those constraining factors have been greatly reduced or, in some cases, eliminated entirely. And that contributes to the trends toward inequality. That contributes to, I think, a divergence between how the people who run these companies and economic elites think about their responsibilities and the policies that they promote with political leaders. And that’s had, I think, a damaging effect on the economy overall. ” Leaning forward in his chair, Obama described the profound structural shifts in the economy over the past two decades that voters often don’t appreciate or acknowledge. “If you are a   worker, you saw manufacturing head out to China,” he said. “You’re in a town, the plant closes. But  —   in part because of the housing bubble  —   a whole bunch of   manufacturing workers could suddenly shift into construction. ” The underlying economic decay was covered up by cheap credit, as homeowners made up for the shortfall in wage growth with   second mortgages and unprecedented loads of   debt. And that “meant that people felt pretty good in terms of their purchasing power even though their underlying situations hadn’t improved appreciably,” Obama said. Then the bubble bursts, “and suddenly they get washed away. ” Those construction jobs have returned slowly, and many of those manufacturing jobs never came back at all. “They’d be much worse off had we not taken the steps that we took,” Obama said. “But they have a sense that it’s a little more of a struggle for them than it might have been for their parents or for their grandparents. ” Obama considered the problem from a political perspective. “In some ways,” he said, “engaging in those hard changes that we need to make to create a more nimble, dynamic economy doesn’t yield immediate benefits and can seem like a distraction or an effort to undermine a bygone era that doesn’t exist. And that then feeds, both on the left and the right, a temptation to say, ‘If we could just go back to an era in which our borders were closed,’ or ‘If we could just go back to a time when everybody had a   plan,’ or ‘We could just go back to a time when there wasn’t any immigrant that was taking my job, things would be O. K.’’u2009” He didn’t mention Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders by name, but the implications were obvious. Perhaps the biggest economic shift during Obama’s presidency came from a piece of legislation that wasn’t sold as such. On March 21, 2010, Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. It was Obama’s boldest piece of legislation and the one that will most likely define him. It has been largely viewed as a social program, a way to provide health insurance to tens of millions of uncovered citizens. But the bill, which affected not just insurance companies but doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, also had an immediate and growing impact on the economy as a whole. The health care industry accounts for 17. 5 percent of the U. S. gross domestic product, and health care spending accounts for 8 percent of the average household budget. Of course, the largest economic challenge most Americans ever confront comes in the form of a sudden health crisis. “In the long term,” Sperling told me, “the Affordable Care Act will actually be seen as one of the great economic accomplishments, not just health care, economic. Because it actually is closing a key part of the insecurity gap. ” In closing that gap, though, Obama has been confronted with a knotty economic and political paradox. The legislation was designed to slow the growth of health care costs, even as it extended coverage. Slowing the growth of an industry that accounts for nearly a fifth of the U. S. economy is inevitably going to mean slowing the growth of the economy as a whole. The legislation was also designed to exert a more subtle economic influence. For most of the postwar era, most Americans received health insurance from their employers, in the form of benefits. If they quit their jobs or were fired, they could lose those benefits, and if they had a   condition, they could have a hard time getting them back, even if they got a new job with good benefits elsewhere. That meant they would be much less likely to leave a job, and that meant employers could be a little less worried about raising wages, because they had a somewhat captive work force. In the age of the gig economy, more portable insurance could transform the way we work and potentially have a real effect on wages in some sectors. In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office released a report estimating that the Affordable Care Act would “reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1. 5 percent to 2. 0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024”  —   a seemingly disastrous outcome for the economy. But, the director of the office, Doug Elmendorf, later wrote, “The reason for the reduction in the supply of labor is that the provisions of the A. C. A. reduce the incentive to work for certain subsets of the population. ” In other words, a lot of people worked because they had to, in order to keep their insurance. Now they could quit, even if they were sick a positive development for them, but with a perverse effect on the economy. And for all of that, Americans do not yet seem to be feeling the benefits of the new program, in part because the benefits remain uncertain. “If your health care premiums go up by 6 percent, you’re still irritated,” Obama said, “even though the trend lines have been those premiums are going up 15 percent. ” Republicans were unanimously opposed to the bill, and Obama could pass only so much major legislation before the congressional election that many expected to flip House control from the Democrats to the Republicans, as it indeed did. That meant that he had to choose the A. C. A. over any number of other   agenda items, including another stimulus, perhaps in the form of a massive infrastructure bill, which would have given the economy an unambiguous boost. “If you went back a few years, you might say, ‘Well, he should’ve focused even more on pushing through a bigger fiscal stimulus, which he could have if he wasn’t going for the Affordable Care Act,” Rogoff said. “That was a   he made, and it cost him. ” Obama knows it. “The fact of the matter is, is that our failure in 2012, 2013, 2014, to initiate a massive infrastructure project  —   it was the perfect time to do it low interest rates, construction industry is still on its heels, massive need  —   the fact that we failed to do that, for example, cost us time,” Obama said. “It meant that there were folks who we could have helped and put back to work and entire communities that could have prospered that ended up taking a lot longer to recovery. ” After 2010, all that was available to Obama was executive action: The ascendant G. O. P. made anything else nearly impossible. So the president turned more and more to regulatory rule changes and executive orders. He raised the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10. 10 he overhauled immigration policy to protect some illegal immigrants from deportation (the Supreme Court just heard a case to overrule the action) he signed an order calling on government agencies with oversight of industry to find ways to make them more competitive, like pressing cable companies to let customers use cable boxes made by rivals. But without Congress, the big legislative moves, the ones that would really change history, seemed past. “I can probably tick off three or four   things we could have done where we’d be growing a percentage or two faster each year,” Obama said. “We could have brought down the unemployment rate lower, faster. We could have been lifting wages even faster than we did. And those things keep me up at night sometimes. ” When the president’s motorcade left Saft to head back to Air Force One, I noticed something unusual: The plant’s parking lot was extremely small. It dawned on me that Obama’s tour of the factory, filled with photo ops and handshakes, had included very little interaction with workers. Instead, he was shown machine after machine, mostly operated by computers. At one point, he was introduced to   a robot named after the Pixar film that takes battery components from a tray. No employees necessary. This giant mecca of innovation, a physical marvel that if built several decades ago would have easily employed a few thousand people, employs only 300. It was a scene that underscored a challenge facing the U. S. economy and one that may be the driving factor behind greater inequality: We’re not only losing jobs to overseas competition, we’re losing them to technology. Obama noted the robots, too. “We just saw here those robots were pretty impressive, but also pointed to the direction the economy is going,” he said. He clearly recognizes the problem  —   he said he spends a lot of time thinking about it  —   but he also knows the solutions will come only when he is long out of office. Many citizens, he said, back on Air Force One, “have to worry about retraining at some point in their careers, because they can’t anticipate being in one place for 30 years. The occupational mix in the economy places greater demands on people because it’s changing more rapidly. And all of this makes people feel that they don’t know what’s around the corner. ” For whatever sense of “uncertainty” business leaders lament, this may be a much more profound sense of uncertainty. “It’s one of the reasons that I pursued the   Partnership,” he said, bringing up the   pact that, uniquely, has divided both parties, “not because I’m not aware of all the failures of some past trade agreements and the disruptions to our economy that occurred as a consequence of globalization, but rather my assessment that most trends are irreversible given the nature of global supply chains, and so we better be out there shaping the rules in ways that allow for higher labor standards overseas, or try to export our environmental standards overseas so that we have more of a level playing field. ” Whether a president can truly improve, or damage, an economy remains an open question. The greatest economic power might in fact remain in the hands of the Federal Reserve. Economists credit the Fed’s policy of keeping interest rates at historic lows with helping to pump up the economy and bring unemployment down. At the same time, the Fed has been blamed for widening inequality, swelling the price of real estate and corporate profits, even as savers and retirees dependent on   assets have suffered. That can cut either way in terms of a president’s economic legacy. Critics of Obama, including the new House speaker, Paul Ryan, credit Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, and Janet Yellen, the current chairwoman, for whatever recovery we’ve had since the crisis, contending it happened in spite of the president. “I think the Federal Reserve has done more,” Ryan said at a January news conference. Frank, for his part, almost jumped through the phone when I mentioned that argument during an interview. “And Bernanke and Yellen were appointed by whom? Neither Bernanke or Yellen would have been able to do what they were doing without his full backing. ” Ultimately, however, Obama said the lessons of his time in office are being misunderstood in the election campaigns. “If you look at the platforms, the economic platforms of the current Republican candidates for president, they don’t simply defy logic and any known economic theories, they are fantasy,” Obama said. “Slashing taxes particularly for those at the very top, dismantling regulatory regimes that protect our air and our environment and then projecting that this is going to lead to 5 percent or 7 percent growth, and claiming that they’ll do all this while balancing the budget. Nobody would even, with the most rudimentary knowledge of economics, think that any of those things are plausible. ” He continued: “If we can’t puncture some of the mythology around austerity, politics or tax cuts or the mythology that’s been built up around the Reagan revolution, where somehow people genuinely think that he slashed government and slashed the deficit and that the recovery was because of all these massive tax cuts, as opposed to a shift in   policy  —   if we can’t describe that effectively, then we’re doomed to keep on making more and more mistakes. ”",0

Trump weighed in on the CORRUPTION FIASCO created and perpetuated by the FBI. 
Comey, the DISGRACED FBI director, re-opened the email investigation into Hillary Clinton’s CRIMINAL mishandling of classified emails after finding 650K NEW emails on Anthony Weiner’s computer that were “directly tied” to Hillary’s case. 
As Hillary began TANKING in the polls, Comey came out and said, “Oh, whoops, nothing to see here, Hillary’s fine, no charges!” 
Now, how the hell do you go through 650K emails in 8 days, when previously it took the FBI over a YEAR to go through 53k? 
It doesn’t happen. 
We all know that the RIGGED SYSTEM which Hillary used to STEAL the primary is the SAME RIGGED SYSTEM she uses to keep her out of jail. 
There are countless GOOD people rotting away in prison for doing a TINY FRACTION of what Hillary did. 
How is that fair? 
In addition, we just learned that Hillary Clinton had her MAID printing off classified documents for her. 
That’s right, he MAID, for the love of god. 
Also, the FBI says that at least 5 foreign countries hacked her system. 
…and this criminal-harpy is running for president? 
No. Over 80% of Americans believe Hillary is GUILTY. 
SAY NO to this vile crap, AMERICA. 
From Politico: 
Reacting to news that the FBI won’t change its determination in the Hillary Clinton email probe, Republican nominee Donald Trump made it clear he still regards her as guilty and is convinced she will ultimately face justice. 
“You can’t review 650,000 emails in eight days,” Trump said Sunday in an appearance at the Freedom Hill Amphitheater. “You can’t do it folks. Hillary Clinton is guilty.”

3452,The Middle East’s sick state,"Will the Middle East be as unstable 10 years from now as it is today? I posed that question this week to a class of students at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. About half answered yes — that things will be as bad or worse, no matter what the United States does.

These graduate students sense what many Middle East experts are beginning to vocalize: The region is caught in a turbulent vortex of change that’s likely to continue for many years, perhaps decades. The drivers are political, social, economic and demographic forces over which the United States and other outside powers have little control. For the next generation, instability may be the rule in the Middle East, rather than the exception.

Predictions about the future based on current trends are always risky because analysts can’t foresee the unexpected “black swan” events that produce radical change. Nobody could have anticipated that a Tunisian fruit vendor’s self-immolation in 2010 would begin a cascade of revolution and civil war in the Middle East. Similarly, we can’t forecast the process that may eventually restore balance.

Economic and demographic data show a region already stressed by slow growth and high youth unemployment. These problems are compounded by refugee flows from wars in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Libya — and worsened by falling oil prices that hinder Saudi Arabia’s ability to provide a buffer.

The International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook, released this month, presents a grim picture. Unemployment will top 13 percent in Egypt and Tunisia this year and reach nearly 12 percent in Algeria. Economies aren’t growing fast enough to provide enough jobs for young people: Growth this year is expected to be 1.3 percent in Iraq, 2.5 percent in Lebanon, 2.6 percent in Algeria, 3.8 percent in Jordan and 4 percent in Egypt.

Saudi Arabia’s growth forecast has been slashed more than 1.5 points to 3 percent this year and is projected to decline further next year because of oil prices. The Saudis are waging a bloody air war in Yemen, apparently convinced that threats to their security are external. But the more intractable problems may be internal, with the Saudi budget falling into what the IMF warns will be “substantial deficit” this year and next.

“Tepid” growth and falling oil exports mean larger trade and budget deficits, predicts the IMF. The region will suffer a cumulative current-account deficit of 1.9 percent of gross domestic product this year; even the oil-exporting countries will run a deficit of 1 percent. “Deepening conflicts and security disruptions in a number of oil-exporting countries could further undermine economic activity, delay reforms and dampen confidence,” warns the IMF.

The Middle East’s body politic, enfeebled by these disorders, has been ravaged by sectarian and civil wars. The International Rescue Committee estimated this month that 11.4 million Syrians, or about half the population, have fled their homes. The Syrian disaster has affected the whole region. To take just one example, poverty has more than doubled in Iraqi Kurdistan, according to a recent World Bank report.

As weak governance structures have buckled across the Middle East, extremist groups have become more powerful. The most potent is the Islamic State, which exploded out of the remnants of al-Qaeda in Iraq. But many other groups across the region are fusing popular rage with sectarian and tribal bases of support. Even if the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, can be “degraded” in Iraq and Syria over the next three years, as President Obama hopes, the underlying disorder in the region could spawn ISIS 2.0, or even 3.0.

Observing the devastation in the Middle East is a bit like watching a hurricane pummel a vulnerable coastline. Outsiders can try to mitigate the destruction and provide humanitarian relief. They must also try to protect themselves from collateral damage. But they can’t stop the raging winds and surging tides from leveling fragile structures. As disaster-management experts have learned, a big storm has to blow itself out before rebuilding can begin.

Graham Allison, who heads the Belfer Center here, argues that the U.S. government should be careful about trying to fix problems in the Middle East until it understands them better. He contrasts the deadly Ebola virus with the ideological contagion of the Islamic State. We know what causes Ebola and how to stop it, Allison wrote recently in Time magazine, but there is no such clarity about how the Islamic State toxin spreads or how it can be cured.

What we do know is that this extremist virus has taken root in a body that is already severely weakened and showing no signs of recovering soon.

57553,Gunmen kill four  in sectarian attack in Pakistan,"QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Gunmen in southwestern Pakistan killed four members of a Shi ite Muslim Hazara family, including a 12-year-old boy, on Sunday, in the latest sectarian attack on the minority community, a senior police official said.  Two men on a motorcycle opened fire on a family of eight while they at a filling station some 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of Quetta, the capital of Pakistan s Baluchistan province. Aside from those killed, two others were wounded. Two  female members of the family were unscathed, having remained in their vehicle.  This was a sectarian attack,  senior police officer Tanveer Shah told Reuters, adding that no group has claimed responsibility for the shooting. Hazaras are frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants, and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Many Hazaras fled to Pakistan during decades of conflict in neighboring Afghanistan, and nearly half a million now live in and around Quetta. In 2013, three separate bombings killed over 200 people in Hazara neighborhoods, raising international awareness of the plight of the community. More than 20 Hazaras have been killed in similar shootings in Baluchistan in the past two years, police say.  The ongoing violence in the province has fueled concern about security for projects in the $57-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan s southern deep-water port of Gwadar.

41048,"U.S. industry seeks faster permits, simpler rules in Trump regulation reset","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. industry groups have told President Donald Trump’s administration that they want two main things from his promised regulatory overhaul: a speedier permit process and simpler environmental rules. Associations representing the drilling, refining, mining, and building industries have submitted hundreds of pages of documents to the Commerce Department and Environmental Protection Agency in recent weeks, outlining regulations they want to see eliminated or modified. The comments, many targeting the EPA, come in response to a pair of executive orders Trump signed during his first weeks in office, meant to cut the regulatory burden on companies. Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress have already moved to rescind a slew of Obama-era environmental protections, including some aimed at combating global climate change. The EPA’s regulatory reform office alone has received remarks from more than 65,000 people and groups, many of them criticizing the regulatory rollback plan as a potential threat to public health. But business groups have embraced the plan, calling it the best chance in more than a decade to reshape the regulatory landscape and boost growth, without undermining air and water quality. “Last time I remember this was 2001. That was the last big opportunity to make some changes,” said David Friedman, vice president of regulatory affairs for the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers industry group.  That year, then Vice President Dick Cheney chaired an energy task force that produced a National Energy Policy report, a road map to boosting domestic systems and supplies. Much has changed since: U.S. oil and gas production hit all-time highs during the administration of former President Barack Obama, helped by high crude prices and improved drilling technology. This time around, industry groups appear focused on easing the permitting process for new facilities and installations, according to a Reuters review of the comments. A common refrain, for example, is for Trump’s administration to reject a planned tightening of ozone rules under the U.S. Clean Air Act’s National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Several groups said this would expose them to increased permitting hurdles for operations and new facilities. Several groups mentioned other permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act that they say are redundant. These include the New Source Performance Standards, the Maximum Achievable Control Technology rules and the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.  “We have one proposal to replace eight different regulations with one that achieves the same environmental benefit but substantially reduces the cost of compliance,” said Rosario Palmieri, vice president for regulatory policy at the National Association of Manufacturers.  The American Petroleum Institute representing oil and gas companies and the Edison Electric Institute, representing electric utilities, are seeking changes in the way companies must account for greenhouse gas emissions. Comments from members of the public and environmental groups revealed worries that this process would undermine environmental protections. The EPA’s comment period ended on May 15. Jeff Baker, a military veteran and energy investor from Alabama wrote: “I implore you, as defenders of our nation’s health and security, to avoid shortsighted steps that might create prosperity for a few in the short term, at the expense of the many in the long term.” Trump’s administration requested the comments from industry as part of two similar and concurrent processes, stemming from his executive orders.  The first order, issued on Jan. 24, directed Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to review which U.S. regulations were burdens for domestic manufacturing. The Commerce Department solicited feedback from industry as a result of that order, with a March 31 deadline. Ross told Reuters in an interview last week that the department was condensing the comments into a series of recommendations that could be presented to Trump as early as this month. [nL1N1IB240] The second order was issued Feb. 24, directing all U.S. agency heads to launch a process to identify regulatory burdens. Each agency has its own timetable. The EPA, which is taking the brunt of the feedback, started its public comment period on April 11 and closed it this week. ",0
49947,Trump dangles Middle East peace plan to limit Jerusalem outcry,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump told the Palestinian president of his intention to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, he assured him a peace plan being put together would please the Palestinians, officials said, an apparent effort to limit fallout over his break with longtime U.S. policy.         Trump s phone call to Mahmoud Abbas on Tuesday, the day before he made his bombshell announcement on Jerusalem, appeared to shed new light on behind-the-scenes efforts by White House advisers to craft a peace blueprint expected to be rolled out in the first half of 2018 but which has now been thrown into doubt because of an angry outcry across the Middle East. With Palestinians declaring it will be difficult for the United States to act as an honest broker after essentially siding with Israel on one of the central disputes in the conflict, administration officials said they expected a  cooling-off period.  Trump s team, led by his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, will press on with development of a plan to serve as the foundation for renewed Israeli Palestinian negotiations, hoping the furor will blow over and that any pause in diplomatic contacts with the Palestinians will not last long, U.S. officials said. But amid protests in the Palestinian territories and uncertainty about whether the Palestinians will stay engaged in the peace effort, one U.S. official said the process could still be disrupted.  If they are still saying they re not going to talk, we re not going to do it then,  the official said. Washington s major Western and Arab allies have warned that Trump s decision on Jerusalem could doom attempts to achieve what the U.S. president has called the  ultimate deal  of Israeli-Palestinian peace. Details of the negotiating framework have yet to be finalized and there is little indication of tangible progress. But officials said it would deal with all the major issues, including Jerusalem, borders, security, the future of Jewish settlements on occupied land and the fate of Palestinian refugees, and would also call for Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to provide significant financial support to the Palestinians. In his call to Abbas on Tuesday, Trump sought to temper the blow from his Jerusalem announcement by stressing that the Palestinians stood to gain from the peace plan that Kushner and U.S. Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt were crafting, according to two U.S. and two Palestinian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. Trump told Abbas, a Western-backed moderate, that the final peace blueprint would offer the Palestinians an important settlement that they would be pleased with, but did not provide specifics, the sources said. Abbas told Trump in response that any peace process must result in the Palestinians having their capital in East Jerusalem, a Palestinian official said. Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and later annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. A senior U.S. official said Trump told Abbas he wanted to discuss the issues in person and invited him to visit the White House, although the timing was unclear. Palestinians have grown increasingly concerned that any plan Trump unveils will shortchange them, a fear that deepened with Trump s formal endorsement of Jerusalem as Israel s capital, upending decades of U.S. policy that the ancient city s status must be decided in negotiations. Jerusalem is home to sites holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians. Kushner, who had no government or diplomatic experience before joining his father-in-law s White House, has mostly kept his discussions under wraps. U.S. officials say Kushner backed Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and order the eventual relocation of the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv, although he was aware of the potential for complicating his peace efforts. But one White House official said that because the peace effort had not yet led to negotiations between the two sides, Kushner s team believed the initial outcry over the Jerusalem decision could eventually be overcome. The official said the plan, which he described as comprehensive and going beyond frameworks put forth by previous U.S. administrations, would likely be unveiled before the middle of next year. A key test of keeping the peace efforts on track will be whether Abbas goes ahead with a scheduled meeting with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence when he visits the region in mid-December.  A senior Palestinian official said on Thursday that Pence was  unwelcome in Palestine.  Trump, the officials said, had insisted that U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital was not meant to prejudge the outcome of future negotiations on that issue or others between the two sides. U.S. officials acknowledged that Trump s Jerusalem moves could also put a damper on cooperation from Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, which the administration is trying to enlist in the peace process. They contended, however, that the broader Arab world was also concerned about keeping Trump involved in confronting Iran and fighting Islamic State militants and was therefore unlikely to remain disengaged for long from efforts to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One U.S. official said the Palestinians were in such a weak position that they would ultimately have no choice but to stay involved in U.S.-led peace efforts. Another argument that Trump s aides will likely make to Palestinians is that having granted Israel recognition of its claim to Jerusalem, the U.S. leader might now have more leverage for seeking concessions later on from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the U.S. official said.

789,Virginia Tech is right on schedule despite loss to Clemson.,"Virginia Tech is right on schedule despite loss to Clemson.
(Before It's News)
Sometimes after a loss to anyone there can be tendency to ask, what’s wrong, why did we lose, etc etc. Virginia Tech lost Saturday night to Clemson 31-17, but Hokie fans should still very encouraged by their program direction.
Let’s be honest Clemson is just at another level from the rest of college football save Alabama right now. I’m saying it right now, this Clemson team is better than last year’s national championship team. Last season was more about incredible individual talents like Mike Williams and Deshaun Watson. This season Clemson is a more complete team with a defense that is simply frightening. This Hokie team isn’t really competing with Clemson at the moment, but I believe they will be down the road.
We’ve seen the Virginia Tech program win 10 games in it’s first year under Justin Fuente. DC Bud Foster’s record speaks for itself. They started this year beating a good West Virginia team and dominanting the rest of their schedule until Saturday night. Coaching wise Virginia Tech is near or at the level of Clemson.
Player for player though Clemson is a measuring stick for where Virginia Tech is trying to get. It’s a very simple matter for the Hokies – recruit, recruit and recruit some more. Josh Jackson is a young, talented QB that Virginia Tech can build around. In year 2, it was probably asking too much for Virginia Tech to beat a team of Clemson’s caliber. Give it a couple of more years under Fuente, the Hokies are on the rise and right on schedule.

38338,Trump congratulates China's Xi on 'extraordinary elevation',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping to congratulate him on a new leadership line-up unveiled at the Communist Party Congress in Beijing. The two also discussed North Korea and trade, Trump said in a Twitter post. “Spoke to President Xi of China to congratulate him on his extraordinary elevation. Also discussed NoKo & trade, two very important subjects!” Trump wrote. Xi told Trump China would “unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development” and promote “coordination and cooperation among world major powers”, the official Xinhua news agency reported late on Wednesday. “China attaches great importance to the Sino-U.S. relations and is willing to promote the long-term, healthy and stable development of bilateral relations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefits,” Xinhua cited Xi as saying. Trump is expected to meet Xi when he visits China next month, when the two are likely to discuss issues related to North Korea and U.S.-China trade. ",0

Close More than 10,000 balloons and nearly two tons of red, white, and blue confetti were released at the moment polls closed. NEWS November 8, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 44 · News · Politics · Election 2016 
NEW YORK—Marking the joyous occasion with singing, dancing, and a chorus of ecstatic cheers, an estimated 2 million citizens gathered beneath the Times Square countdown clock Tuesday night to celebrate the end of the 2016 election season, sources reported. 
The crowd of revelers—many of whom had arrived in the early morning to stake out prime viewing locations—reportedly swelled in volume throughout the night, spilling over into nearby streets as many popped bottles of champagne, embraced loved ones, and finally joined together in a boisterous countdown seconds before the polls were scheduled to close. 
“God, this is so amazing,” said local man Mark Edwards, gazing up at a fireworks display signaling the conclusion of the incessant media coverage, debates, stump speeches, and campaign advertisements of the election cycle. “I can’t even begin to describe how excited everyone is here. It’s really unbelievable.” 
“W !” he shouted, his voice nearly drowned out by the sound of Kool & The Gang’s “Celebration” emanating from loudspeakers situated on buildings around the square. 
According to witnesses, the scene was one of unbridled merriment, with roars of delight sweeping through the crowd every time the enormous LED screens in Times Square showed that voting had ended in another state. As vote totals began to come in, thousands in attendance reportedly raised their arms in jubilation, unfurled homemade banners, or placed calls to family members, often yelling to be heard over the sound of whistles, noisemakers, and the exuberant din of the crowd. 
Throughout the night’s revelry, celebrants were also seen craning their necks and hoisting children onto their shoulders to view the One Times Square Astrovision screen displaying live feeds of equally raucous celebrations in downtown Los Angeles, Chicago’s Loop, Miami Beach, Market Square Park in Houston, and other locations throughout the country 
“We stood out in the cold all day to get a good spot, but what’s a few extra hours of discomfort when you’ve been looking forward to this for so long?” said Alice Castillo, who told reporters she had driven there from Baltimore with her two daughters to be part of the excitement. “Could we have stayed home and watched it all on TV? Of course. But nothing compares to the thrill of sharing this incredible moment with so many other people.” 
“When the clock struck zero and everyone erupted into cheers, it was pretty magical,” Castillo added. 
While the crowd was said to have thinned after the polls closed along the East Coast, a reported 250,000 remained well into the night to take in the joyful atmosphere and pack the area’s overflowing bars. One of the Times Square celebrants, 36-year-old Brett Cleaver, said the night’s festivities had caused him to reflect on the past year and consider how tonight represented a fresh start. 
“Beginning tomorrow, I’m going to try to cherish every second I have where I don’t hear the phrase ‘swing state’ or see footage from a campaign rally,” Cleaver told reporters, beaming at the prospect of never again looking at an article that speculated on how undecided voters would react to Donald Trump’s or Hillary Clinton’s latest statements. “For tonight, though, I’m just soaking up as much of this moment as I can.” 
Added Cleaver, “I’m already excited to come back and do this again in 2020.” Share This Story: WATCH VIDEO FROM THE ONION Sign up For The Onion's Newsletter

2743,Doctors in Aleppo Tend to Scores of Victims in Gas Attack - The New York Times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   As rebel negotiators unveiled a new plan on Wednesday for a political transition in Syria, doctors in the city of Aleppo were still treating people in intensive care after an attack believed to involve the use of chlorine gas sickened more than 120 people, including 10 women and 37 children. At least two people died in the attack, which witnesses said was carried out by government forces in the   section of Aleppo. Rescuers and citizen journalists who went to the scene said by text message that there had been a strong smell of bleach. One of the victims, a    girl named Hajer Kyali, died Wednesday afternoon. She had been in intensive care since the attack, which doctors said they believed had struck her family’s house directly, delivering a deadly dose of the gas. Medical staff members described seeing people with symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, sneezing, irritation of the eyes, nausea and in some cases respiratory failure. Such symptoms are consistent with attacks involving chlorine, which can kill in high concentrations. Rescue workers also said that four members of the White Helmets volunteer rescue group had been killed responding to attacks in the past day in the provinces of Aleppo and Idlib, both in “ ” strikes that hit the area a second time to target rescuers. The rescue workers said the Sukari district, the same neighborhood hit by the suspected chlorine attack on Tuesday, was struck on Wednesday by two barrel bombs, killing an estimated 20 people, according to witnesses and rescuers. Doctors were still working to confirm the final death toll. In London, the Syrian oppositions’ negotiating body, the High Negotiations Committee, presented a new vision of a political transition to end the civil war, now in its sixth year. The group said that it would preserve the human rights of all Syrians and the institutions of the state, including the military, and seek to avoid the mistakes made by the United States occupation in Iraq. That means having a military council made up of both   and opposition figures, and no wholesale purges, with punishment only for those directly responsible for crimes. The committee’s leader, Riyad Hijab, a former Syrian prime minister who defected after a crackdown on protests that began in 2011, laid out the plan in London at a meeting of countries supporting the opposition. He said that the group could talk with members of President Bashar  ’s government but that, at the end of the negotiation process, Mr. Assad should leave office  —   a proposal that fails to resolve an impasse with Russia and the Assad government, which insist that he can stay in office during a political transition. The gas attack came three years after the Syrian government agreed to give up its chemical weapons program under a deal brokered by the United States and Russia. It also accompanied several days of intense aerial bombardment of eastern Aleppo by government and allied Russian forces that have continued as Russian and American diplomats seek to negotiate a   deal. There was no independent confirmation of who carried out the attack or that chlorine was used the Assad government and its armed opponents have accused each other of using chlorine as a weapon of war. A recent United Nations report determined that both the government and Islamic State militants have used chemical weapons on several occasions. In Aleppo, the forces fighting the government range from groups with American backing to factions that until recently were officially affiliated with Al Qaeda. The Islamic State is not a player in the city. The first death reported from the gas attack in Sukari was that of Abdulkareem Afefa, 29. Numerous videos and photographs that doctors, rescuers and witnesses shared online showed men, women and children being treated with oxygen. Abdelkafi   an activist and citizen journalist who filmed the aftermath of the attack, said that when he arrived at the scene, the fumes were still so strong that he could not catch his breath. “I couldn’t speak to the camera without a mask,” he said. Mr. Hamdo said that some people at the scene had reached such a level of despair  —   having concluded that publicizing such attacks brings no help from the outside world and may even bring more danger  —   that they tried to stop him from filming. “Some people think that if they told the world that they are being killed, Assad will drop many weapons on them,” he said. He added that people had told him they believed the government was targeting civilians to encourage them to flee, and that showing many civilian victims makes the area a good target for the next attack. “The message from Assad and Russia is this: ‘You have to accept my conditions or die,’” he said. The sputtering negotiations over a   include a Russian proposal for civilians to leave the area residents fear they will never be allowed back. Russia and the government say that civilians have been taken hostage by the fighters in   areas. “Nothing, just chemical once again, don’t worry, don’t be sad, it is normal,” Aref   an   activist with the Aleppo Media Center, said in a sarcastic text message as he shared his photographs of victims. In 2013, after sarin gas attacks killed more than 1, 000 people in   suburbs of Damascus, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution authorizing militarily enforceable sanctions for any party using chemical weapons in Syria. But Russia has blocked the use of those sanctions against the Syrian government, which denies it was responsible. Under threat of United States retaliation for the sarin attacks, the government agreed to eliminate its previously secret chemical weapons program. Chlorine gas is not listed as a banned chemical weapon in the international Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria agreed to join under the agreement, but its use as a military weapon is banned under international law.",0
16005,"Exclusive — House Freedom Caucus Not Budging, Official Position Is for Full Repeal Alternative to Paul Ryan’s Obamacare 2.0 - Breitbart","House Speaker Paul Ryan’s Obamacare 2. 0 does not and will not have 218 votes —  the requisite number to pass the House of Representatives —  since the House Freedom Caucus’ official position is lined up against the bill, Freedom Caucus sources tell Breitbart News. [A member of the House Freedom Caucus tells Breitbart News that is an official position of the House Freedom Caucus is against the earlier version of the bill —  a leaked draft —  but also formally for the full repeal bill and then a replacement bill from Sen. Rand Paul ( ). That position has not changed nor it is expected to at any point between now and if and when leadership attempts to ram this bill through the House, this member added. Also, for the House Freedom Caucus to take an official position —  which again binds its members to vote a certain way in the House, meaning that as a bloc the Freedom Caucus is expected not to vote for this bill —  it requires 80 percent of its membership to back the official position. That means, given that there are a few more than 40 members of the House Freedom Caucus, there are definitely well more than 30 members who voted internally to take that position in the Freedom Caucus —  and it appears as though the Freedom Caucus’ 40 plus members are completely united in support of this position.  While technically the House Freedom Caucus has not yet taken an official position on this bill, the official position it has taken on healthcare in favor of real full repeal and then the Paul bill precludes members from voting for this bill —  unless something changes down the road, which it is not expected to. “Our members are united in opposition,” a House Freedom Caucus source told Breitbart News. “If they brought it up for a vote today it’d fail. Our group is united in the belief that this is the moment the freedom caucus exists for  —   to block this monstrosity and protect the POTUS from walking into an electoral disaster in 2020 because of it. ” Simply doing vote math, Republicans need 218 votes to pass any bill out of the House of Representatives. There are more than 40 members of the House Freedom Caucus. With only 237 Republicans comprising the majority in the House, and 193 Democrats with 5 vacancies, Republicans cannot afford to lose approximately 20 votes depending on those vacancies and absences. No Democrats are expected to vote for the bill. If the vote fails, as it is expected to at this time, then Ryan will be in serious trouble in terms of his credibility. He has repeatedly publicly stated that he will be able to deliver 218 votes for this Obamacare 2. 0 legislation, “The American Health Care Act,” at multiple press conferences over the past few days. Ryan’s bold promise to deliver the votes for this bill no matter what is a risky move, with at least more than 40 Republicans against it when he can only afford to lose less than 20, since twisting more than 20 arms is a tough thing to do on an issue this important. It remains to be seen what will happen next, but top conservatives are already calling on Ryan to withdraw Obamacare 2. 0 and go in a different direction than this way before things get worse. A failure by Ryan would be especially embarrassing for Republicans, including to President Donald Trump.",0

45290,Clinton gains in online betting markets after U.S. presidential debate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s probability of winning the White House gained in online betting markets following the first debate of the campaign on Monday night between her and Republican Donald Trump. A Clinton contract on the popular PredictIt betting market gained 6 cents from the previous day’s level to 69 cents, while a contract favoring Donald Trump’s prospects for victory tumbled 7 cents to 31 cents. Contracts are priced from 0 cents to 100 cents, with the contract price equating to a probability of whether that candidate will win the Nov. 8 election. The price swings for both candidates were the largest since early August, and placed Clinton’s lead in that market at the widest in about two weeks. Clinton’s prospects also improved on the Irish betting site Paddy Power.  About halfway through Monday’s debate, she was shown as a 1-to-2 favorite, and those odds shortened to 4-to-9 in the moments after the debate ended. Trump’s odds lengthened to 23-to-10 from 9-to-4. The swing following the debate put the brakes on a big Trump price rally on PredictIt that coincided with a tightening in most public opinion polls. The implied probability of him winning had risen to 38 cents on Sunday from just 28 cents at the end of August.  Bets on Trump fell as low as 5 cents on February but went up as high as 44 cents in May. Bets on Clinton, the persistent favorite in most wagering markets, went as low as 37 cents in January and as high as 79 cents in August.  The debate on Monday was the first of three scheduled face-offs between the two candidates before the Nov. 8 election. ",0

13887,"Pujols Hits Slam for 600th HR, Leads Angels Past Twins 7-2","ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP)  —   Albert Pujols hit a grand slam for his 600th homer, becoming the ninth member of the club during the fourth inning of the Los Angeles Angels’   victory over the Minnesota Twins on Saturday night. [Pujols reached the milestone in theatrical style, putting a low pitch from Ervin Santana ( ) into Angel Stadium’s short   porch for his 14th grand slam.  The Anaheim crowd roared while fireworks soared overhead for the   ’s ninth homer of the season and his 155th for the Angels. Pujols moved to the West Coast nearly six years ago after 11 spectacular seasons in St. Louis. Andrelton Simmons and Kole Calhoun hit    homers in the third inning for the Angels. Max Kepler homered for Minnesota. Matt Shoemaker ( ) pitched   ball into the seventh inning for his fourth victory in his last five starts. Pujols staked the Angels to a   lead with his ninth homer this season. After going three straight games without a homer since hitting No. 599 on Tuesday, Pujols became the   player to reach the   club  —   and the first to join it with a slam. Santana had yielded just one earned run in 29 innings on the road this season before struggling at Angel Stadium, where he was Pujols’ teammate during the 2012 season after the slugger signed as a free agent and before Santana was traded to Kansas City. Santana dropped to   in his four career starts against the franchise that signed him as an undrafted free agent in 2000 and employed him for 13 years. He still ranks fifth in Angels history with 223 games started and seventh with 96 victories. After Minnesota took a   lead in the first inning on Kepler’s RBI single, Shoemaker found his groove and largely limited the Minnesota lineup that scored 11 runs on Friday. The Angels went ahead in the third when Simmons delivered a   shot to left for his sixth homer and Calhoun added a shot to right for his eighth. Pujols came up next with a chance to give the Angels      homers  —   but he struck out on three pitches. An inning later, Pujols made history. TROUT OUT, Mike Trout will get the cast off of his left hand Sunday, and he begins rehabilitation Monday on his injured left thumb. He’s still expected to be out for at least five more weeks, and he says he won’t stop sliding headfirst after injuring himself doing just that in Miami. “I just think I have to have more control when I dive headfirst,” Trout said. “They say ( ) doesn’t slow you down, but it feels like it slows you down. ” TRAINER’S ROOM, Angels: OF Cameron Maybin hasn’t swung the bat since going on the disabled list with a bruised side muscle. Manager Mike Scioscia isn’t sure whether Maybin will be ready to return on Friday as previously hoped.   …     Reliever Cam Bedrosian (groin) had a solid rehab appearance and could be ready to return Tuesday. UP NEXT, Twins:      Jose Berrios (  2. 70 ERA) makes his fifth start of the season in the series finale. Angels: Ricky Nolasco (  5. 07 ERA) faces the Twins for the first time since they traded him and Alex Meyer to Los Angeles at the 2016 trade deadline.

43413,Investors gird for impact of Trump healthcare measures,"(Reuters) - An order by President Donald Trump that could scale back enforcement of some Obamacare provisions is unlikely to sink health insurance stocks, but shares of hospitals and Medicaid providers could be under pressure over fears more poor people would lose coverage, analysts said. President Trump signed an executive order on Friday urging government departments to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation” of provisions of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, that imposed fiscal burdens on states, companies or individuals. While the order lacked details, it signaled the start of an effort by Trump and Republicans to repeal and replace the program, which expanded health coverage to some 20 million people. Obamacare has been plagued by increases in insurance premiums and deductibles and by some large insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc and Aetna Inc, largely pulling out of the system. Shares of UnitedHealth and Aetna were little changed in early trading on Monday. The equity markets dislike uncertainty and Trump’s executive order introduces at least a modest level of new uncertainty, J.P. Morgan analyst Gary Taylor wrote in a note on Monday. The new administration may no longer enforce an Affordable Care Act rule requiring individual Americans to pay a penalty for not carrying health insurance, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said on ABC’s “This Week” program on Sunday. The healthcare exchange system that is the cornerstone of the Affordable Care Act depends on premiums from healthy, younger individuals, typically between ages 18 to 34, to offset higher expenses for covering older, less healthy individuals. The scrapping of enforcement was “a real risk” for 2017 insurance exchanges enrollment, Sheryl R. Skolnick, a healthcare analyst for Mizuho Securities USA Inc, said in a research note on Saturday. “We have to wonder why the hospital companies and investors who have pushed the stocks back up to pre-election levels would be so enthusiastic,” Skolnick wrote. But young people did not buy health insurance at desired levels, even when penalties increased for not having the coverage, said Ana Gupte, a healthcare services analyst for Leerink Partners LLC in New York. “Fundamentally, I don’t think it’s going to make a difference,” if the so-called ‘individual mandate,’ requiring individuals to buy coverage or pay a penalty, is scrapped, said Gupte. Some experts also question whether the Obama administration itself was vigilant about enforcing the rule. “We’re not sure as to how vigorously it was being enforced anyway,” said Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for E Squared Capital Management. Still, Trump’s plans could pressure shares of insurers such as Molina Healthcare Inc, Centene Corp and WellCare Health Plans Inc, who administer state Medicaid plans, over concerns that the number of insured, especially among the poorest, would shrink.    Molina’s shares were down 0.7 percent, while Centene’s shares were down 0.5 percent. If Medicaid funding becomes less than what states are receiving now, “it will put pressure on the number of people who are covered through Medicaid expansion,” Gupte said.   Hospitals may also be on the hook for more unpaid medical expenses as the number of uninsured individuals increase and seek emergency room treatment, Gupte added.  Longer term, though, the hospital industry is lobbying to get more money for unpaid expenses and “it looks like they will get what they want,” Gupte said. Shares of hospital operators such as HCA Holdings Inc, Tenet Healthcare Corp and Community Health Systems Inc were down about 1 percent. “In reality, the executive order is just a sideshow to the main event – the Repeal/Replace legislation that Republicans are expected to introduce this year,” Taylor said.

18838,Muslim Radical Salman Hossein says Hillary will win,"( henrymakow.com ) “Salman Hossein (left) was forced to flee Canada in 2010 with police on his tail for antisemitic activities. From his exile in Dhaka, Bangladesh, he says Hillary will win and lead the US to world war. Masonic Jewish central bankers can’t allow Trump to win because he will turn on them. They are already losing world control and Trump would be the final nail in their coffin.” — Henry Makow 
LD: Salman was a prolific commenter on this site whose posts had to be carefully monitored because of their constant obscenities and bloodcurdling threats of mass extermination. A Muslim radical, to put it mildly. 
Salman’s prediction that Hillary will win is not, in my opinion, a far-fetched one. I think it is a distinct possibility if all this, as I suspect, is pure theater. A huge surprise could be in store for us in the next few days. 
A sudden announcement by FBI Director James Comey, two days before the election, giving Hillary a clean bill of health over her problematic emails, could result in a last-minute surge in support of Hillary that could sweep her into the White House. According to one report, the FBI “may be able to sift through them [the emails under investigation] before election day .” Additional information harmful to Trump, involving “ his close links to the Kremlin “, could also be manufactured in a bid to help Hillary. 
All this, however, is pure speculation. [LD] 
SALMAN HOSSEIN : After 9-11, there were eight regimes that had not submitted to the authority of the Jewish bankers. Four of them either got taken out or bullied/bribed/coerced into bowing down – Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan. The only problem is that recently China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Turkey have broken out of the sphere of control. Syria is still independent and fighting to maintain its sovereignty against Israeli expansionism and Banker domination. 
Putin recently put out an arrest warrant for George Soros for currency manipulation and has issued a decree banning the Rothschild clan from Russia. Russia is also causing problems for the Israelis and the West by defending the regime of Bashar Al Assad from Nusra and Da’esh/ISIS. Israeli expansionism has been kept in check by Russia. China has also more or less wrested free of control from the International Jewish oligarchy. As a pro-Israeli asset , Trump is not a threat to Israeli expansionism in Gaza and the West Bank. He has even opened up a campaign office in Israel. He is essentially aligning white gentile power with the Israeli-Jewish supremacist camp. He only cares about Israel and will facilitate even worse oppression of Arabs and Muslims not only in Palestine and the rest of the Greater Middle East but in the Western world as well. He consistently repeats the false “ Muslim terrorist “ narrative. He is even worse than George W. Bush Junior . As the alternative to the US Dollar, the new BRICS monetary system is also challenging Jewish control of international finance. The heavyweights in the BRICS alliance are Russia and China. There are those who claim that BRICS is also covertly run by the Jewish bankers. I don’t buy this. The Chinese are fully aware of the Jewish question . The Russians kicked out Jewish criminals . They won’t be able to penetrate the economy as well as they have done in the Western world. THE DILEMMA OF JEWISH SUPREMACISM Jewish supremacists view European gentiles as either pawns for their game of global conquest and perpetual warfare or if that is not feasible – their targets of destruction and hatred. Historically speaking, Jews have been expelled over 109 times in history. 105 of these times have been in Europe. That is why left-wing Jewish groups are so vehemently pushing for the replacement and liquidation of indigenous Europeans by either making them a minority or making those countries uninhabitable via the anticipated thermonuclear warfare which they are instigating . Most White Americans, Australians, Canadians, and New Zealanders are also of European ancestry – and are also targets for destruction/revenge by these Jewish extremists/supremacists for many decades now. The influx of refugees by Jewish groups with the assistance of organized crime gangs is Talmudic vengeance par excellence. For the Diaspora Jews, its an all-or-nothing zero sum game. They either take their chances with NATO and go all in against China, Iran, Russia, and eventually Turkey or eventually risk losing more countries from their grip and/or control. However, going head on against them will lead to World War Three. Their hatred for white gentiles is so great (due to past perceived historical injustices) that they are willing to risk death themselves in the process of getting others killed. There is no where the so-called (Jewish dominated) elite can really hide or travel to. All their contingency plans are being exposed . TRUMP IS LESSER OF TWO EVILS Trump is the lesser of the two evils because he does not appear insane enough to go after China and Russia at the same time. However, I personally prefer NATO going up against China and Russia. The West has been killing defenseless people as target practice alone for the last few centuries alone – they need a challenge this time. Russia along with assistance from China will put them in their place. The great news is that the Jewish war-mongers have already won! Hillary has already been declared the war president of the United States. I support Hillary Clinton in her desire to go to war against Russia. I have been praying for the day this would happen. In fact, thermonuclear warfare is just right around the corner. Nobody should be complaining about this. Without thermonuclear warfare, there is no way International Jewry’s grip on temporal power can be crushed. That is the other reason I left Canada!

12923,A Rare Pacific Islander Captivates Its Neighborhood - The New York Times,"TAVEUNI ISLAND, Fiji  —   In Fiji, flowers can take on a spiritual, magical significance. They are strung together as garlands for ceremonies and festivals or worn as an ornament behind the ear on any given day. The South Pacific archipelago is home to about 800 species of plants found nowhere else in the world. But the most special is the tagimoucia, a crimson and white flower that hangs down in clusters like a chain of ruby raindrops. Because of its beauty and rarity, it has attained a kind of celebrity status. “Just to touch it and see it with my own eyes,” said Lina Sena, 41, her sentence trailing off as she held a clipping recently. “See how we are treating it? It is history. ” Except for scattered sightings on a neighboring island, the flower grows only on a single mountain ridge on Taveuni, one of the northern islands. The tagimoucia is the unofficial floral emblem of Fiji and has a prime position on the nation’s $50 bill. But to Fijians, its significance stems from several legends of romance and heartbreak. Seeing the flower “was on my bucket list,” said Ravi Kumar, 31, who grew up in Fiji but later moved to Australia. Mr. Kumar spent a recent day on Taveuni, traipsing through the forest before finally sighting the flower atop its woody vine. Taveuni, known as the Garden Island for its rich volcanic soil and farming, is crowned with dense, dark rain forest that is often shrouded in mist. Mr. Kumar said he made the trek because the flower’s legend was “one of the tales you grew up with” in Fiji. Those tales can vary depending on whom you ask. The song “Tagimaucia ga” by Percy Bucknell, a traditional composer, describes how an outsider seized power on Taveuni and made the flower a symbol of his chieftainship. Another tells of a young girl whose tears became tagimoucia flowers when her parents scolded her for not doing her housework. According to Emori Tokalau, a governmental liaison to Taveuni’s clan leaders, only the flower’s custodian can tell the true legend. That is Ratu Viliame Mudu, the chief of Somosomo village on the island’s western side. Mr. Tokalau described the custodianship “as a form of copyright,” giving the holder authority to grant permission for outsiders to visit the flower or use its likeness. He had to get the chief’s approval before using the tagimoucia on his office letterhead, he said. To receive permission, one must arrive at the village with a sevusevu  —   a gift or offering  —   often the traditional root drink kava. A small ceremony is performed, with men in sarongs and women in long skirts gathered around. On a visit to the village in November, the chief’s son, Akuila Cavuilati, spoke about the flower’s history. “When I was growing up, it was the legend that my   carried and gave to us,” he said. The tagimoucia already existed before the legend, but only as a simple white flower, Mr. Cavuilati said. That changed when a young princess fell in love with a man from another village, a union her parents vetoed. She ran away in despair. Village warriors searching for the princess could hear her crying in the forest (tagimoucia can be translated as “crying tears,” Mr. Cavuilati said). However, all they could see were tagimoucia flowers with a mysterious new addition: the ruby red petals. Those petals are the girl’s tears, Mr. Cavuilati said. As a boy, Mr. Cavuilati often climbed the mountain with his brothers to pick tagimoucia flowers, sometimes sending them into the capital, Suva, for display at festivals. “During that time there were so many flowers,” he said. “Nowadays, it is very hard to find. ” Until about 30 years ago, access to the flower came only by foot. But then a cellphone tower went up on the mountain’s peak, along with a service road. Now people can drive the   pass more easily. Mr. Cavuilati said rarely did anyone come to him to hear the legend or receive his blessing for their journey to the flower. The path up the mountain is a    hike that starts near Somosomo. Along the way, it was easy to see why the forested mountain was the tagimoucia’s natural protector before the access road was built. The trail is littered with felled trees and craters from giant root systems that were ripped out of the ground by cyclones. After several hours of hiking, the grandson of Somosomo’s chief, Viliame Mudu, spied a small cluster of flowers halfway up a tree. That was the sole sighting of ruby red petals by our group that day. The tagimoucia’s peak flowering season of November and December coincides with school’s end, so the flower is a “hot commodity” for graduation garlands, said   Lin, an anthropologist who completed his Ph. D. thesis on conservation in Taveuni. During that period, local hotels bring flowers down for their guests. One morning, Alfred Lewenilovo, 26, headed up the mountain carrying a sugar cane knife and an empty backpack. He said his sister in Suva requested tagimoucia flowers for her 21st birthday garland. The flower’s popularity worries some on Fiji. “People are going there to see it and put it around their necks, then they come down. After two days they throw it into the rubbish bins,” said Marika Tuiwawa, a botanist with the University of the South Pacific. The fragility of the flower’s existence has always been a concern because of the small areas, or microhabitats, where it grows. While the opinion that the flower is now overpicked is widely held, no research has been done to confirm that, said Dick Watling, from  . The conservation group had investigated the possibility of a Taveuni National Park that would provide more protection to the tagimoucia as well as the forest it inhabits. But its Taveuni office closed in 2014, from a lack of interest and funding. The area where the flower is found is currently a forest reserve, but it is often encroached upon by farmers, Mr. Watling said. “The real issue is that we have this enormous area of almost pristine forest, the last in Fiji,” he said. Unless the government realizes the value of that “it will become increasingly fragmented. ” For now, the tagimoucia continues to inspire Fijians. On a ferry that sails from Taveuni to Suva, I held a tagimoucia clipping given to me by the village chief of Tavuki. The flower turned heads. A young boy whispered “tagimoucia” as he walked past. A woman pointed and mouthed the flower’s name before breaking into a smile. And Ms. Sena indulged in a mini photo shoot. “Take another one  —   a good one,” she said as her daughter repositioned her camera to capture the flower, now perched behind Ms. Sena’s ear.",0
23861, Kellyanne Conway Laughs Off Trump’s Pending Child Rape Case Because Hillary Sent Some Emails (VIDEO),"Can we all finally agree that Donald Trump s campaign is just ridiculous at this point? On Monday, Kellyanne Conway showed up on CNBC to do what she does best: embarrass the human race with her stupidity.Apparently satisfied with Trump s ability to latch on to the next-to-no information referenced by FBI Director Comey s unethical, unprecedented, and likely illegal letter to Republicans. Comey hasn t reviewed the emails discovered on a computer owned by renowned pervert and husband to unfortunate Clinton aide Huma Abedin,  Anthony Weiner, who is currently being  investigated for allegedly sexting a 15-year-old girl.The emails likely contain nothing new and have likely already been disclosed, but the Right is in the midst of a feeding frenzy over the non-information contained in the letter, declaring that the investigation into Clinton s emails had been reopened and ramping up the  criminal  rhetoric.Conway condemned Clinton s suggestion that all the emails be released to the public   in other words, an effort to fully inform the public   as she called the Clinton campaign  sneaky  for demanding the facts be released. Just ask Huma what s on there, just ask Anthony Weiner what s on there,  she said during the interview.  They are now trying to politicize the FBI.  Conway accused Clinton of  encouraging  supporters to boo Comey, who has such a reaction coming for his unethical behavior in the eyes of pretty much anyone who doesn t consider red trucker hats fashionable. It s a very dangerous precedent to have somebody that was secretary of state, first lady, U.S. senator, wants to be president of the United States and be commander-in-chief encouraging people to boo,  she said, apparently forgetting a time not so long ago when Trump and his illiterate, inbred fans also booed the FBI (and Comey specifically). And where are we now?  Conway said after host Andrew Ross Sorkin pointed out that Trump has called for Clinton s imprisonment multiple times.  She is going to be in her second FBI investigation. One FBI investigation, let alone two, do we think this is normal? I think people have been asking the right questions about the wrong candidate. Who s really unqualified? Who s unfit to be president? Who has shown what they would do with their national security information? Who has shown it s always about her and her petty peevish political self? Then Sorkin struck a nerve by stating facts   namely that Trump has been named in a rather damning child rape lawsuit that is due to start in December. The girl in question is 13   just one year older than Paris Hilton when Trump says she was hot and two years younger than the models he used to creep on in their dressing rooms. My understanding is that no matter who wins, we re going to be dealing with the email issue after this if she s the president,  Sorkin told Conway.  If Donald Trump is the president, he s got the child rape case that s going to happen that was just given a date. Naturally, Conway snorted and attempted to deflect, calling any question about the child rape case exactly as legitimate as questions about Trump s taxes, which he has not released: Oh, come on, that you would analogize the two. Give me a break,  she seethed. Next you are going to ask me where his taxes are. That s a whole separate issue, but we re going to have legal cases for each candidate,  Sorkin countered. But to Conway, a little child rape is unimportant when Hillary sent some emails and Anthony Weiner is a bit pervy, too: That s such a ridiculous conflation. To just throw the rape word in there when we ve got 650,000 emails based on an active investigation of Huma Abedin s pedophilia husband because he s sexting pictures of himself to some 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, I think that s just ridiculous. Don t worry though   Conway s pervert is going to Make America Great again by building a wall to keep brown people out, banning and rounding up members of religions he doesn t like, and attempting to resist banging his daughter like he has said he wants to do for all these years   starting at around the time he said Paris Hilton was hot when she was 12.Watch the segment below:Featured image via screengrab",1
50649,Election crisis engulfs Honduras with rivals neck-and-neck,"TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduras faced a growing election crisis on Wednesday, with its U.S.-friendly president edging ahead in troubled vote count that his centrist rival, a television game show host allied with leftists, has rejected, saying he is being robbed. Three days after polling stations closed in Honduras  presidential election, there was growing international concern with no clear winner and both men claiming victory, despite nearly a fifth of ballots remaining uncounted. Stricken with poverty, drug gangs and one of the world s highest murder rates, Honduras is one of the United States  closest military and ideological allies in Central America. On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department urged a quick conclusion to the vote count, which has been widely criticized. Resolution to the festering crisis had appeared possible on Wednesday when both candidates vowed to respect the final result once disputed votes had been scrutinized, issuing identical signed statements brokered by the Organization of American States (OAS). But the accord did not last long. Centrist opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla - who had watched with disbelief as his original 5-point lead evaporated, allowing center-right President Juan Orlando Hernandez to edge ahead by 3,000 votes - told reporters that he rejected the document he had signed just a few hours before. Nasralla cited an hours-long technical glitch at the election tribunal, and fears that Hernandez was planning to unilaterally declare himself victorious, as his reasons for dismissing the results of the electoral body.  They take us for idiots and want to steal our victory,  said Nasralla, who heads a coalition of leftist and centrist parties.  The document I signed today with the OAS has no validity,  he added, calling it a  trap  and pledging to take to the streets to defend his votes. The OAS said in a tweet that it regretted Nasralla had withdrawn from the pact, and that it would continue working for  justice  in the elections. Later on Wednesday, police fired tear gas to disperse Nasralla supporters gathered outside the election tribunal where the vote was being counted. The fumes entered the building, prompting its staff to be evacuated, television images showed. With around 82.89 percent of ballots counted, the center-right Hernandez had 42.2 percent of the vote, while Nasralla was on 42.1 percent, the tribunal said. Hernandez s National Party appears set to retain control of Congress.   As he caught his rival, Hernandez s blue-clad supporters celebrated, chanting the president s name at a party base in capital Tegucigalpa, TV images showed, while thousands of Nasralla supporters took to the streets.  I m here so that justice and the will of the people is carried out, because we elected Salvador Nasralla, and Juan Orlando Hernandez wants to steal his victory,  said 22-year-old David Ramirez, a red political flag draped over his shoulder.   The election body published more than half of the results of Sunday s election early on Monday, but faced international criticism for an ensuing 36-hour delay in releasing further data. The count halted again late on Wednesday afternoon. Tribunal chief David Matamoros apologized to the nation for a fresh computer glitch that derailed operations.  We ve had a problem that we regret and that we didn t expect to have, and that we re resolving as quickly as possible,  he said.  Sometimes in an election, you can have a system failure, but never in a moment as critical as this.  International observers said the delays were damaging the credibility of authorities and threatened to undermine the legitimacy of the next president. On Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert urged Honduran authorities to review the election results without delay.  We urge all candidates to respect the results,  she said.  Behind closed doors, the parties of Hernandez, the pre-vote favorite, and Nasralla were discussing immunity from prosecution for current officials and carving up positions in government, two diplomats told Reuters on Tuesday. With a booming voice and finely coiffed hair, Nasralla is one of Honduras  best known faces, hosting a sports programme and a television game show that features scantily clad women. In one interview, he boasted of his penis size and his sexual performance.  He is backed by leftist former President Manuel Zelaya, who was ousted in a coup in 2009 after he proposed a referendum on his re-election. The possible return of Zelaya risks fueling concern in Washington. Hernandez has won U.S. praise for helping tackle a flow of migrants to the north and extraditing drug cartel leaders to the United States. He was credited with lowering the murder rate and boosting the economy, but was also hurt by accusations of ties to illicit, drug-related financing that he denies. ",0
8559,Allen West Reveals How Obama’s Pentagon Just Destroyed Recruiting Efforts for Decades,"UNREAL: Calif. Soldiers Billed for Thousands After Military Decides Not to Honor Decade-Old Enlistment Bonuses 
Why, West wondered, would any sane citizen risk his or her life to serve in a military system so corrupt and backward that it would make its veterans pay back their rightfully earned bonuses? 
What made this move by the Pentagon even more unsettling was how much money it had frivolously wasted on other things that the colonel believed did not deserve to be funded. 
“Here we have a Pentagon stating it will pay for sex change surgery for those who are suffering from gender dysphoria,” he wrote. “I just want to know, how much money did the Department of Defense pay for those ‘ transgender handbooks ‘ and training materials?” Advertisement - story continues below 
He asked a similar question regarding all the taxpayer funds wasted on providing welfare to illegal immigrants , on operating sanctuary cities and on importing “tens of thousands of Syrian refugees into the country, with benefits.” 
“Why not cut that off and provide the funding for these men and women who’ve served?” West wrote. “This has been 10 years past and now we’re punishing those who’ve gone on with their lives?” 
“They did nothing wrong, they didn’t seek to defraud our nation — heck, they put their lives on the line to backfill the manpower shortages made by politicians and government bureaucrats,” he continued. “Is this truly how we honor those who have served?” 
No, it is not. Or rather, it should not be, though clearly Obama disagrees. Advertisement - story continues below",1
46354,"Obama, Saudi prince focus on Iraq and Syria in Washington meeting","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia on Friday discussed ways to support Iraqis in their fight against Islamic State militants and the importance of a political transition in war-torn Syria, the White House said. Obama met with Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval office for about an hour. The deputy crown prince is visiting the United States to repair frayed relations and to promote a plan, known as Vision 2030, to slash the kingdom’s dependence on oil exports. “The President expressed appreciation for Saudi Arabia’s contributions to the campaign against ISIL,” the White House said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group.  The two talked about steps to support Iraqis “including increased Gulf support to fund urgent humanitarian and stabilization needs,” the White House said.  U.S. officials have expressed unease about the Saudi-led campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which according to the United Nations and human rights groups has resulted in large numbers of civilian casualties. Saudi Arabia is worried about closer relations between the United States and Iran, Riyadh’s arch enemy, after a 2015 nuclear deal.   Obama welcomed Saudi Arabia’s commitment to a political settlement of the Yemen conflict and support by the Gulf Cooperation Council, of which the kingdom is a member, to address humanitarian needs and rebuild the country, the White House said.  On Syria, Obama and the prince talked about the importance of supporting a political transition away from President Bashar al-Assad, the White House said. The United States is working with international partners on what it calls a Syrian-led transition process facilitated by the United Nations, but so far there has been little progress.  Over 50 diplomats at the U.S. State Department signed a memo, leaked on Thursday, that was critical of the Obama administration’s Syria policy and called for targeted military strikes against Assad’s government.  Asked about the memo, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir, also in Washington, told reporters the kingdom had been arguing for a “more robust intervention” including airstrikes, a no-fly zone, and a no-drive zone, from the beginning of the five-year civil war.  Obama does not see a military solution to the crisis in Syria, White House spokeswoman Jen Friedman said.  Both Washington and Riyadh are anticipating the release of classified pages of a U.S. report into the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, that some U.S. lawmakers have alleged link Saudi government officials to the attacks. Jubeir said investigations show that the allegations “are not correct and they don’t hold.”  ",0
21209, Paul Ryan Is So Unpopular Even 8th Graders Refuse To Pose In Pic With Him (VIDEO),"House Speaker Paul Ryan is hugely unpopular, garnering only a 29 percent approval rating. Apparently, 8th graders disapprove of him, too. While on a field trip in Washington, D.C. on Friday, about half of the 8th-grade students from a South Orange Middle School refused to do a photo-op with Ryan. Instead, the nearly 100 students opted to sit in a parking lot across the street while the remaining students took part in the photo op, according to Mashable.Elissa Malespina, a school librarian and the parent one of the eighth graders who declined the photo op, said that she is proud of her son. I am so proud of my son and 1/2 the 8th grade at South Orange Middle School,  Malespina wrote on Facebook.  They went to D.C. on a field trip and toured the Capitol building. The kids had a chance to have their picture taken with Paul Ryan and over half the class choose not to, including my son! What a powerful statement. I can t take a picture with someone who supports a budget that would destroy public education and would leave 23 million people without healthcare,  Matthew Malespina, a student at the school, told The Village Green. It s not just a picture,  student Matthew told ABC News.  It s being associated with a person who puts his party before his country. I think that taking the picture represents that you agree with the same political views and I don t agree with his political views so I chose not to be in it,  eighth grader Wendy Weeks said.To some of the students, it had to do with Ryan s association with Donald Trump. I didn t want to be in [the picture] because he believes in most of what Trump believes in,  Louisa Maynard-Parisi, told The Village Green.Even though their politics might be different from Ryan s, other students decided to participate. I thought it would be interesting to see one of the nation s lawmakers in person even if I strongly disagree with many of his views,  said Alex Klint, one of the 8th-grader s said.Residents weighed in with conflicted feelings. I m sort of torn on this (although each kid has the right to make this choice),  wrote one SOMA resident.  Even though I totally disagree with everything he stands for, he is a legitimately elected official and represents our government at work. Meeting our representatives is an honor for a kid at least for what the office stands for (even if the person occupying that chair is less than honorable). And I do feel if there had been some conservative school where the kids refused to pose with President Obama, we would have been appalled by that,  the resident added.Matthew s mother told the paper,  It is his right as a citizen to do so and I commend him and his fellow students for doing so in a respectful way. Listen to the children they get it. Photo by Olivier Douliery via Getty Images.",1

7731,Hillary Clinton To Announce Presidential Bid On Sunday,"Updated at 11 a.m. ET

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will officially announce her intention to seek the 2016 Democratic nomination for president on Sunday afternoon, ending years of speculation over her plans to pursue the Oval Office, NPR has learned.

People familiar with the campaign plan say that Clinton, long presumed to be the Democratic front-runner even without a formal announcement, will make the announcement possibly via a video and social media, some sources suggest.

""So far, Mrs. Clinton faces scant competition for the Democratic nomination. Polls barely register former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley or former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb. One potential heavyweight — Vice President Joe Biden — has said he is considering a campaign but has taken few apparent steps to prepare for one. ""On Thursday, former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee surprisingly joined the field, and offered a biting critique from the left of Mrs. Clinton's record on foreign policy. 'The biggest question will be: What exactly did you accomplish in your four years as secretary of state?' he said in an interview. 'There was a lot of dust in the air. Not many concrete accomplishments.' ""

Announcing now gives an edge to Clinton, who lost a bitter contest to then-Sen. Barack Obama for her party's nomination in 2008. The head start would give her fundraising team more time to generate the hundreds of millions of dollars typically necessary to mount a successful presidential bid.

Following the Sunday announcement, Clinton is ""expected to travel to the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa early next week for campaign events. Democratic strategists and advisers spoke on condition of anonymity because Clinton has not yet finalized all aspects of her announcement plan,"" The Washington Post writes.

NPR's Mara Liasson reports that Clinton is ""expected to stay [in Iowa] for at least a month of small, unscripted, events with small groups of voters.""",0

Erick Reis captured this creepy crawly footage as he was leaving a party he was attending. At first glance he thought they were birds in the distance, but a closer look revealed a more terrifying truth.
 
The spiders were crawling up and down silk threads attached to telephone pole wires and trees. The footage gives the impression of spiders falling from the sky.
 
As scary as it seems, it turns out that this is a common occurrence with this type of colonial spider, which is quite social and lives in large communities.

40948,Trump close to picking outside counsel for Russia probe: Washington Post,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is seeking outside counsel to help him during investigations into his campaign and Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, and has narrowed the search to four prominent attorneys, the Washington Post reported on Monday. The lawyers who have spoken to the White House and are widely seen as the finalists are Marc Kasowitz; Robert Giuffra Jr.; Reid Weingarten; and Theodore Olson, the Post said, citing four people briefed on the discussions. The Post said the four spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Giuffra met with Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. The person also said Kasowitz may have had dinner with Trump on Thursday. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meetings. Names could still be added to the list, but two people close to the search told the Post that Trump wants a team of attorneys rather than a single lawyer to represent him. It cited them as saying the team is likely to have lead counselors. The four attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment, the Post said, and they did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. A White House official told the Post that the administration had no comment at the time. The outside counsel would be separate from the White House Counsel’s Office, which is led by Donald McGahn, who served as the Trump campaign’s lawyer. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Moscow tried to sway the November vote in Trump’s favor.

Surveys were sent out to Australians aged over 18 years of age and enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Role, with results of the mail-in only poll scheduled to be announced on November 15.The vote, coming at a cost of AU$122 million (US$94 million), has stirred up more than its fair share of controversy, with the nation divided over whether to vote  yes  or  no.  Surprisingly, Yiannopoulos has become a rather loud proponent for Australians to vote against same-sex marriage, just weeks after his own gay marriage. My gut would be to vote against it, Yiannopoulos told the Daily Mail, adding  I m gay and a Catholic. The highest priority for me is making sure no church, no believer anywhere, is required to violate their religious conscience. I think those things can co-exist perfectly peacefully. I think the state probably should recognize a gay couple who want to commit to one another,  He continued.  But the paramount consideration is not those gay couples   it is religious freedoms. Another fear that Yiannopoulos has is the effect same-sex marriage could have on gay culture.  One of the few advantages of being gay was that you could tumble out of a nightclub at 1am on a Tuesday and no one could have a go at you for it. But if we re buying into these institutions like marriage, I worry that there will be a deadening effect on gay culture. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but comments like these are more than just a little ironic when they come directly from the mouth of a man who recently had his own gay marriage. Photos surfaced of Yiannopoulos  marriage ceremony in Hualalai, Hawaii late last month, with his spouse named on Wikipedia as  John,  although little else is known.Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart in February of this year amid a cloud of controversy after a video emerged where he stated that the relationship between a man or woman and 13-year-old boys can be  perfectly consensual  and a positive experience for the boys.Featured image via Stephanie Keith/Getty Images",1

37987,Trump distances himself from remarks on Putin over election meddling,"HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday attempted to clear up confusion over whether he accepts Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denials of meddling in the U.S. election last year. At a news conference in Vietnam, Trump distanced himself from remarks he made on Saturday in which he suggested he believed Putin when he said there had been no Russian meddling in the election that took him to the White House. The comments had drawn criticism at home because U.S. intelligence agencies have long since concluded there was Russian meddling. “As to whether I believe it or not, I’m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted,” Trump said at a news conference with Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang.  “As currently led, by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.” He was careful to make clear he sided with the intelligence agencies under his own leadership. Former U.S. intelligence director James Clapper had told Reuters: “The fact the president of the United States would take Putin at his word over that of the intelligence community is quite simply unconscionable.”  The Russian issue has clouded Trump’s first year in office and his comments on Saturday were a distraction from his    five-nation Asia tour. Trump said he still believed Putin did not think there had been Russian meddling.     “I believe that President Putin really feels, and feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election,” Trump said, while adding: “What he believes is what he believes.”  Trump said he was not interested in arguing with Putin over meddling and wanted to get on with Russia to work on world problems including North Korea, Syria and Ukraine. Trump has called allegations of campaign collusion with Moscow a hoax. A special counsel, Robert Mueller, is conducting an investigation that has led to charges against Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates. U.S. intelligence agencies have also concluded Russians interfered to tip the election in Trump’s favour through hacking and releasing emails to embarrass Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and spreading social media propaganda.

6313,Comey’s October Surprise Blows Up In His Face As Democrats Drop The Hammer On FBI Boss,"Senate Democrats aren’t playing around with FBI Director James Comey. Four top Democrats sent Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch a letter demanding details on the emails that the FBI is investigating by Monday. In the letter, Sens. Carper, Leahy, Feinstein, and Cardin wrote: 
Senate Democrats aren’t fooling around. They want answers, and they want them right now. As more details become known, FBI Director Comey’s motives have come under criticism. Comey was advised by Attorney General Lynch not to send his letter until after the election, but he sent it anyway. 
Comey worried to FBI employees that his letter would be misunderstood, but he could have easily avoided any misunderstanding by either being specific in his letter or not sending the letter at all. It is becoming difficult to look at Comey’s actions in an objective manner and not see partisan political motivations. 
The FBI Director has interfered in a presidential election with new emails that have nothing to do with the Democratic nominee, but can be used by her opponents for political purposes. 
Democrats are demanding answers, and if James Comey doesn’t answer their questions by Monday, he will be forced to under oath if the Democratic Party wins a majority of seats in the Senate. 
Either way, Comey’s October surprise has blown up in his own face.",1
45629,Bosnian Serbs make shoes for Melania Trump's White House march,"BANJA LUKA, Bosnia (Reuters) - A Bosnian Serb factory on Monday presented two pairs of shoes as a gift for the wife of U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Slovenian-born Melania, in a gesture of support for Trump’s White House campaign. Many Serbs in the Balkans back Trump, ill-disposed to rival Hillary Clinton whose husband Bill backed NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions toward the end of the 1992-95 Bosnian war. He also advocated a 1999 NATO bombing of then-Yugolsavia to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians.  Marinko Umicevic, technical director at the Banja Luka shoe factory Bema, said the gift countered what she called a “dirty campaign” against the aspiring First Lady whose homeland, like Bosnia, was a part of Yugoslavia when she was born. Melania Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention in July ignited controversy, containing a section strikingly similar to words delivered at the Democratic convention in 2008 by President Barack Obama, Michelle. “The shoes for Melania Trump are our response to the dirty comments she has been exposed to as a wife and a mother,” said Umicevic. The shoes, to be sent by express post, were displayed for media on a table, set in a display of white roses. One pair was gold-colored, with cushioned soles fashioned, according to Umicevic, to help Melania follow her husband’s campaign across America. The others were white stilettos for a triumphant walk into the White House. Umicevic said the shoe moulds were made by a factory in Melania Trump’s hometown of Sevnice and designed by Bema’s best shoe designers. “We hope that America will stop being the world policeman,” Umicevic told Reuters. “We are hoping a friendship will come in the future from the United States instead of bombs that Serbs got from Bill Clinton,” he added.

And one person who is standing up to defend the famed actress is none other than famed actor/director Ron Howard.Taking to Twitter, and taking aim at a few Twitter troll, egg profiles and all, Howard lays out some solid facts.

54413,Anti-corruption blogger killed by huge bomb in Malta,"VALLETTA (Reuters) - Daphne Caruana Galizia, Malta s best-known investigative journalist, was killed on Monday when a powerful bomb blew up her car, police said, in a case that stunned the small Mediterranean island. Caruana Galizia, 53, ran a hugely popular blog in which she relentlessly highlighted cases of alleged high-level corruption targeting politicians from across party lines.  There are crooks everywhere you look now. The situation is desperate,  she wrote in a blog published on her site just half an hour before an explosion tore into her car. Locals said Caruana Galizia had just left her house and was on a road near the village of Bidnija in northern Malta when the bomb detonated, sending her car flying into an adjacent field. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, who faced accusations of wrong-doing by Caruana Galizia earlier this year, denounced her killing, calling it a  barbaric attack on press freedom . He announced that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had agreed to help local police investigate the killing and was flying experts to the island as soon as possible.  I will not rest until I see justice done in this case,  he said in a statement, calling for national unity. Around 3,000 people held a silent, candle-lit vigil on Tuesday evening in Sliema, just outside Valletta. The hashtag Je Suis Daphne circulated widely among social media users on the island of 400,000 people, the European Union s smallest state.  Everyone knows Caruana Galizia was a harsh critic of mine, both politically and personally, but nobody can justify this barbaric act in any way,  Muscat said.  The only remedy for anyone who felt slandered was through the courts.  Muscat sued Caruana Galizia after she wrote blogs earlier this year saying his wife was the beneficial owner of a company in Panama, and that large sums of money had been moved between the company and bank accounts in Azerbaijan. Both Muscat and his wife denied the accusations. Looking for a vote of confidence to counter the allegations, Muscat called snap elections in June which he easily won. Recently, Caruana Galizia s outspoken blog had turned its fire on opposition politicians. Malta Television reported that Caruana Galizia had filed a complaint to the police two weeks ago to say she had received threats. It gave no further information. Opposition leader Adrian Delia said the blogger was the victim of a  political murder .  Caruana Galizia revealed the Panama Papers and was the government s strongest critic,  he said, calling for a independent probe of her killing.   We will not accept an investigation by the Commissioner of Police, the Army commander or the duty magistrate, all of whom were at the heart of criticism by Caruana Galizia,  he said. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said he would offer a 20,000 euro ($23,578.00) reward for information leading to the conviction of Caruana Galizia s killers, and European politicians expressed dismay at her death. Frans Timmermans, first vice president of the European Commission, tweeted that he was  shocked and outraged , adding that  if journalists are silenced our freedom is lost . Manfred Weber, head of the conservative bloc in the European Parliament, said the killing marked  a dark day for democracy .   Caruana Galizia took aim at politicians and senior officials from across Malta, seeing the island as a hotbed of corruption.  Malta s public life is afflicted with dangerously unstable men with no principles or scruples,  she wrote last year. Her family asked that the magistrate assigned to investigate the case, Consuelo Scerri Herrera, be substituted because of an alleged conflict of interest, court documents showed. Herrera had sought libel damages after Caruana Galizia attacked her in her blog. ",0
8342,Clinton's super PAC fundraising irks progressives,"(CNN) Hillary Clinton's decision to personally raise money for a super PAC supporting her campaign is agitating her progressive critics, who see the move as further proof that the Democratic presidential frontrunner doesn't share some of their values.

There was never any expectation that Clinton would renounce super PAC money this election cycle. But liberal activists determined to use the Democratic primary to pressure Clinton to embrace a progressive agenda say the idea of the former secretary of state personally wooing the wealthiest class of donors runs counter to the populist rhetoric she's employed this year.

Within days of announcing her White House bid, Clinton had called out wealthy investors for paying too little in taxes and pledged to get big money out of politics. At the time, it was a welcome message for liberal Democrats who are uncomfortable with Clinton's close ties to Wall Street and find the prominent role of super PACs in elections utterly distasteful.

But the recent revelation that Clinton will personally fundraise for a super PAC supporting her campaign -- a decision to play by the rules of a system she has condemned as ""dysfunctional"" -- has invited fresh eye-rolling. It has also exposed a core tension for Democrats, who have increasingly embraced super PACs at the same time that they decry the explosion of soft money in national politics.

Clinton seems to be having fun on the campaign trail

Clinton's campaign is explaining the decision as a matter of political necessity.

""With some Republican candidates reportedly setting up and outsourcing their entire campaign to super PACs and the Koch Brothers pledging $1 billion alone for the 2016 campaign, Democrats have to have the resources to fight back,"" a Clinton campaign official said in an email, who spoke anonymously to discuss the sensitive topic of fundraising. ""There is too much at stake for our future for Democrats to unilaterally disarm.""

Clinton's expected involvement with Priorities USA has highlighted the contrast between her and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is Clinton's only declared rival to date for the Democratic presidential nomination, as well as other potential challengers.

An independent from Vermont seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, Sanders has aggressively opposed super PAC donations. A long-shot candidate without a national fundraising operation, Sanders has no chance of matching Clinton's fundraising haul and has little to lose by going after millionaire and billionaire donors.

On Capitol Hill last week, Sanders told CNN that Clinton's decision to personally court super PAC donors was ""unfortunate.""

""We're living in a world since Citizens United where multi-millionaires and billionaires are playing a horrendous role in the political system,"" Sanders said, referring to the Supreme Court's 2010 ruling that paved the way for super PACs to direct virtually uncapped amounts of money to aid political candidates. ""That's why I believe that we need to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.""

Phil Noble, a South Carolina Democratic activist and supporter of former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a potential Democratic candidate for president, said the development underscores what progressives view as a ""fundamental disconnect"" between Clinton and middle class voters.

""It's not that she raises a bunch of money for a PAC that causes her problems with middle class voters. That is a symptom as opposed to the ailment,"" Noble said. ""The larger illness is she is out of touch with middle class voters -- she does have a lifestyle and a history that is about as alien to middle class voters as corporate jets are to a Subaru.""

And activists who are pushing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to challenge Clinton see campaign finance reform as a major issue.

""Being a true champion for working families like Elizabeth Warren is about clearly and unequivocally supporting such critical priorities as a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United,"" said Erica Sagrans, campaign manager for Ready for Warren, a movement dedicated to drafting Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the 2016 race.

Clinton's personal involvement with Priorities USA marks the latest chapter in the Democratic Party's evolving relationship with super PACs.

Democrats initially fiercely opposed Citizens United. But for all of their rhetoric against super PACs, and as much as the party continues to use the Supreme Court decision as a political rallying cry, over the years political interest has largely won out over progressive idealism.

In 2012, President Barack Obama reversed course, declaring after years of keeping his distance from super PACs that his campaign would participate in raising money for Priorities USA.

Now that tension is being brought to new heights as the party's next likely presidential nominee personally plans to drum up support for a super PAC backing her candidacy.

Clinton allies also see that her fundraising prowess and the depth of her connections with the kinds of donors who can cut multi-million dollar checks will likely make her a formidable competitor against any Republican candidate she may face in the general election. Officials are careful to emphasize, however, that Clinton and everyone else involved with her campaign will strictly follow the law as they solicit funds for Priorities USA.

The 2016 money race is well underway on the other side of the political aisle.

Declared GOP candidates including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as expected candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, are on a fundraising tear. And they've shown no signs of distancing themselves from super PAC money. Cruz launched his campaign in March, and the senator's allies declared that an affiliated network of pro-Cruz super PACs had raised upwards of $30 million in just a matter of days.

The stiff competition against Republican money is a reality that some progressive leaders say they cannot ignore.

Former Vermont governor and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said it would be unwise for Clinton to reject super PAC money.

""Unfortunately, if you don't play by the same rules everybody else does, you end up losing elections,"" said Dean, founder of Democracy for America, one of the groups behind the draft Warren movement. ""The key is to change the rules, and I think we have a much better chance of doing that with her as president than we do with one of the Republicans.""",0
49825,Honduras opposition parties ask for disputed election to be annulled,"TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduras  two main opposition parties on Friday presented formal requests to annul the results of the still-unresolved presidential election, deepening a political crisis that has roiled the poor, violent Central American nation. The Nov. 26 vote has been marred by accusations of electoral fraud, sparking protests, a widespread curfew and a growing chorus of international concern over the situation in Honduras, which has one of the world s highest murder rates.  Opposition leader Salvador Nasralla, who trails conservative President Juan Orlando Hernandez by 1.6 percentage points according to the widely criticized official count, arrived at the election tribunal shortly before the midnight deadline to present his center-left coalition s request.   We re asking for the result to be declared null at the presidential level, due to the scandalous fraud we have discovered,  Nasralla said.  Earlier, Octavio Pineda, the secretary of the third-placed Liberal Party, presented a similar document, saying the vote should be annulled due to a violation of constitutional norms.  There have been violations since the president of the republic was allowed to participate in the electoral process when the constitution prohibited it,  Pineda said. The Liberal Party s candidate, Luis Zelaya, has repeatedly said Nasralla won the election. Hernandez s bid for a second term, which was made possible by a 2015 Supreme Court decision on term limits, divided opinion in the coffee-exporting nation of 9 million people. The election has been plagued with problems since voting stations closed.  The tribunal declared Nasralla the leader in an announcement on the morning after the vote, with just over half of the ballot boxes counted. However, it gave no further updates for about 36 hours. Once results then started flowing again, Nasralla s lead quickly started narrowing, sparking a major outcry.  On Thursday, tribunal chief David Matamoros said there would be a re-count of 4,753 ballot boxes that arrived after the 36-hour pause, and which the opposition has claimed are tainted. The OAS, which on Wednesday said it may call for new  elections if  irregularities  undermine the credibility of results, had previously called for a recount of those 4,753 ballot boxes.  Marlon Ochoa, Nasralla s campaign manager, reiterated that the coalition wants a full recount of the complete 18,000-odd ballot boxes. On Wednesday, Nasralla said he no longer recognized the Honduran tribunal because of its role in the process. The tribunal has 10 days to respond to the requests.  ",0

48892,Kurdish-led Syrian groups plan to attend Sochi talks: officials,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Kurdish-led Syrian groups plan to attend Russia s proposed Syria peace talks in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Kurdish officials have said. The Syria peace congress was originally scheduled for Nov. 18 but was postponed and the Kremlin said on Thursday that no new date had been set. If the invitation is renewed,  we will attend Sochi and every other meeting that concerns the Syrian crisis as representatives of the people s will  Sihanouk Depo, an official of Syria s main Kurdish party, PYD, told an affiliated website on Wednesday.  We are still invited,  Badran Jia Kurd, a senior Kurdish official, told Reuters on Thursday. If the framework for the congress still stands,  we will attend , said Jia Kurd, an adviser to the administration that governs Kurdish-led autonomous regions of Syria. It would mark the first time Syria s main Kurdish groups are brought into peace talks. Although they now run at least a quarter of Syria, they have so far been left out of international talks in line with Turkish wishes. Before the Sochi talks were postponed, the PYD said in November it had been invited and favored attending. Since the conflict erupted in 2011, the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and its allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north. The YPG spearheads the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias fighting Islamic State militants with Washington s backing.  Their territorial grip has expanded since joining forces with the United States, though Washington opposes their autonomy plans.  Turkey views the PYD and the YPG as offshoots of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey. Last month, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan s spokesman said Russia had told Ankara that the PYD would not be invited to the peace talks.    The Kurdish groups share enmities with both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s government and with neighboring Turkey. This week, Assad described the U.S.-backed militias as  traitors . On Wednesday, in an interview with Iran s Arabic language Al-Alam television, Syria s deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad equated the Kurdish-led forces with Islamic State.  There is another Daesh called SDF,  he said, using the Arabic acronym for the militant group that until recently controlled swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. In his interview on Wednesday, Depo said:  Any attack from the regime will be a failed venture.  ",0
14900,Letting Go Of Old Patterns Of Reaction,"Leave a reply 
Mary O’Malley – A friend of mine was gifted a vacation on a river barge through France and Germany. She was really excited because she could never afford to do this on her own. Her itinerary included a flight from Seattle to New York and the next day, she and her cousin would fly to Europe together. 
As they were getting ready to go through the international security checkpoint, the TSA officer would not let my friend through because her passport had expired. At that moment, a feeling of panic came over her when she realized she had grabbed the wrong passport. As the panic began to intensify, she tuned into her body and used her breath to calm herself down and think rationally. 
Having done awakening work for some time, she realized that reacting to whatever Life is offering only creates suffering. She said, “Mary, I can’t believe it. If this happened years ago, I would have had a temper tantrum and been in tears all day. Instead, I calmly told my cousin to go on without me and I would have a friend in Seattle overnight my passport so I could take a flight the following day.” 
This is the power of accepting whatever Life brings. She added “I did not react or panic when I realized I would have to pay for a new ticket and stay in New York by myself. It all turned out so differently than what I thought, and it was all okay.” 
Whenever we are faced with a challenge, whether it is a cut on our finger, a raging boss, or an expired passport, we all react in our own unique ways. One of the core ways we can heal ourselves is by getting to know our own patterns of reaction. Some of the standard modes of reaction are the stoic, the pleaser, the worrier, the rager, the freezer, the rescuer, the victim, the judger and the self-absorbed one. We put these reactive parts of ourselves together into our own particular style. 
Our patterns of reaction can bring so much heartache into our lives. My primary mode of reaction was to freeze, and like all patterns of reaction, it would tighten me, isolate me and cut me off from the flow of love that is Life. It got stronger as I got older, and it became much more entrenched when I tried to make it stop. Then I learned how to see it and meet it with understanding and mercy. Only then was I able to free-up this frozen energy and learn how to respond to Life rather than always living in reaction. 
This process of seeing, loving and letting go of your patterns of reaction happens in three phases. 
First phase: You are caught. You either can’t see your patterns or, if you do, you have little willingness to do anything about them. You also don’t recognize the consequences that come from living out of your repetitive reactions. When you decide you don’t want to live this way anymore, you usually declare war on the pattern, trying to wrestle it to the ground. This only works for a short period of time because you haven’t done the work needed to dissolve the pattern. 
When the pattern comes back again, you then get caught in self-judgment (I did it again) and despair (I will never get out of this). You begin to move into the second phase when you see that the price you pay for taking care of yourself in your old ways isn’t worth it, and you understand that trying to wrestle it to the ground doesn’t work. 
Second phase: As you come to realize that living out of your old patterns isn’t how you want to live, and trying to get rid of them seems to only empower them, you begin to become curious about what is going on and feel the possibility of living another way. 
At the beginning of this phase, when your patterns of reaction are triggered, you will get lost in them most of the time. But slowly, you become more curious and more merciful with yourself. Even when you get completely lost, there comes a time when you can let go of judgment and despair, and simply notice how you are reacting. 
This may be right in the middle of the pattern, a few minutes afterwards, or a few days afterwards. You become more curious than controlling and more compassionate than judgmental. 
You finally come to the place where you can actually stand with the discomfort of not following your pattern. This almost feels like detox, and it is good to have the support of other people as you learn how to be with your experience rather than running away from it. The more you can be with yourself, the more it opens your heart. And that is really what you have been longing for all along – the ability to live from your own heart. 
Third phase: As your ability to see and let go of your old patterns increases, you enter the third phase. This is where your primary relationship with yourself is one of compassion and curiosity. You still may get caught in your patterns, but only for short periods of time, and rather than bringing up judgment or despair, they become an invitation to open back into Life. 
The more you can meet yourself exactly as you are, the more you discover how to live from your own truth. You can now let go of the idea that a good life is one where everything is under control. Instead, you learn how to ride the ups and downs of your life, trusting yourself, trusting your life. You then become the awakened heart that heals not only yourself but also the world. 
There isn’t a clear delineation with these three phases. On any particular day, you may touch into all three phases. But the more you can be curious and merciful with yourself, the more you will naturally gravitate toward the third phase – the place of truly becoming yourself. This is the greatest gift you can give to yourself and to Life. SF Source Mary O’Malley  ",1
646,Las Vegas massacre: It could have been even worse,"Cedric L. Alexander is a CNN law enforcement analyst and deputy mayor of Rochester, New York. The views expressed here are solely those of the author.
(CNN) At least 58 people were killed and over 500 injured when 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas. The crime instantly entered the record books as the worst mass shooting in modern American history.
The thing is -- it could have been worse.
I know that sounds lame. But I have been in law enforcement for more than 40 years, and I am no Pollyanna. It could have been worse is a simple statement of fact. If the police had gone after him with anything less than military-grade equipment, weapons, and training, there is no doubt it all would have been far worse.
As far as we know at present, Paddock had an arsenal of firearms in his room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, some of which he used against concertgoers penned into an open-air venue 32 stories beneath his windows. Among the weapons were .223 caliber and .308 caliber rifles equipped with telescopic sights, at least one of which had been altered to function in fully automatic mode.
Paddock had a mountain of ammunition with him, thousands of rounds. And, ensconced within a locked room in a jam-packed hotel, shooting down at a crowd from very high up, he was virtually unassailable — at least for a span of many, many lethal minutes.
Paddock was an accountant by trade and a gambler by avocation, a man with no known military experience. Nevertheless, he had both armed and positioned himself like a modern military sniper. The weapons and ammunition were, for all intents and purposes, military grade . The tactics were military-equivalent -- he broke out two windows to achieve two tactical angles of fire.
Facing a perpetrator like Paddock, police need more than courage, integrity, and skill. They also need the kind of equipment the Las Vegas officers had at hand on Sunday. There, officers had assault rifles ready in their cruisers. The department had the MRAP -- Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected -- military vehicles essential to transporting officers, under fire, right up to where the threat was. The rifles and vehicles are standard issue to Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) officers.
Most important of all, the Las Vegas department had the SWAT officers themselves with the training to use their lethal equipment, and they had policies in place to ensure that this equipment was used to save lives, not to intimidate the community.
One of the most commonly and sincerely expressed concerns I hear from communities -- and have heard them for a long time as a law enforcement executive and now as a deputy mayor — is about the "" militarization "" of police. People really do want the police to ""serve and protect"" them. They want the police to partner with the community to make everyone safer. They want to feel that the police are allies and guardians in the neighborhood, not a hostile army of occupation.
In a constitutional democracy, these are the right feelings to have.
In 1997, the National Defense Authorization Act created the 1033 Program , which allowed the Defense Department to transfer excess military equipment to police forces that requested it. Much equipment was acquired this way -- everything from cold-weather clothing to flashlights to ammunition, but also major military hardware, including grenade launchers, aircraft, and armored vehicles.
When such tactical equipment is doled out to departments whose leaders have not formulated policies for its use and whose personnel are not trained to use it, all you get is a militarized police force that looks like it's at war with the community.
In my law enforcement career, nothing gives me more pride than having taken part in the early evolution of community policing back in the 1980s. As a champion of community policing, I have expressed my concern when SWAT teams and 1033 equipment is misused. When I was called in to consult on the unrest that followed the August 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, I was then and am still convinced that the indiscriminate use of military-style vehicles, military-looking assault weapons, and BDU (Battle Dress Uniform) gear transforms a community's perception of the police from partners in safety to hostile invaders.
But then there are the worst-case scenarios. Terrorist attacks, mass shootings, hostage taking, violent bank robberies -- these are crimes in which perpetrators are typically heavily armed, often tactically armed. Whatever else the police are sworn to do, they are sworn to respond to these worst-case scenarios intelligently, bravely, and selflessly. In Rochester, New York, where I am deputy mayor and former police chief, we are made safer by the presence of a great SWAT team, which has some of the best operators I've seen in my visits to many police departments across this country.
Most police officers take pride in the job they do. They take pride in using the right tools and tactics for the application, situation, or mission at hand. They don't put on riot gear to make a traffic stop. They don't roll up in an MRAP when people are peacefully protesting.
As it happened, Stephen Paddock took his own life before the SWAT team breached the door to his room. I imagine he killed himself because he knew he could not prevail against a ""militarized"" police force.
I know that the Las Vegas community is thankful it has such a police force, because the worst-case scenario is not the daily case but it is the daily possibility. These are the times in which we live.

Odds are, the Las Vegas shooting's record-setting status will not prove permanent. Twenty-seven were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, 49 killed in an Orlando, Florida, nightclub in 2016, and at least 58 killed in Las Vegas.
Mass murder on a military scale does not happen every day in America. But as we've seen, it may occur any day. Accordingly, we need police departments with agile, proactive, and courageous tactical policies.
We need appropriately trained and equipped police officers who can respond on a military scale when necessary. We need police and civil leaders who have the knowledge, intelligence, empathy, courage, and imagination to decide when such a response is necessary to save lives.
For all their unspeakable grief and pain, the people of Las Vegas now know their community has such leaders and such police officers looking out for them.",0
58294,Former Venezuelan prosecutor meets Mexican attorney general,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Venezuela s former chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega met Mexico s attorney general on Thursday, a Mexican official said, weeks after she fled her homeland accusing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of involvement in corruption. Ortega, who was removed from her position earlier this month, said a week ago she had evidence that Maduro was involved in graft with construction company Odebrecht. The 59-year-old Ortega has said she would give details of the corruption cases to authorities in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. Mexican attorney general Raul Cervantes met Ortega for around 10 minutes in Mexico City, an official at the attorney general s office said. He gave no further details of the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity. Late on Thursday, Ortega posted a picture on Twitter of herself with Cervantes in Mexico, saying the two had met to  coordinate actions in the fight against corruption.  Pictures posted on social media earlier on Thursday showed Ortega arriving at Mexico City airport. Ortega says she has been persecuted by opponents in an effort to hide details of high-level corruption and that she has proof of it. She was a key player in Venezuela s government before breaking with it in March. Ortega left Venezuela for Colombia and traveled to Brazil to meet prosecutors last week. Odebrecht admitted in a settlement with U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors to paying bribes across 12 countries to win contracts. According to a U.S. court ruling, Odebrecht paid about $788 million in bribes in countries including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela between 2001 and 2016. Mexico s government has been sharply critical of the Maduro administration, accusing it of undermining democracy. ",0
22141, ‘Cards Against Humanity’ Maker Has Amazingly Annoying Way To Force GOPers To Hold Town Halls,"Cards Against Humanity has to be one of the best card games ever. Also, its creator is likely one of the most creative human beings of our time. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that this individual, Max Temkin, would have a rather interesting way of contacting his Senator. Said Senator happens to be Ron Johnson (R-WI).Instead of letters, Temkin is sending potatoes to Senator Johnson. Each has a simple message:  Hold a Town Hall.  There is a very good reason for Temkin s going after Johnson specifically. The Senator threatened to have a veteran arrested if he persisted in his requests to hold a conversation with Johnson in person. The constituent, Earl Good, told local station Channel 58 the following of his efforts: The reason I reached out to Ron Johnson, I disagreed with several of the cabinet appointments that were made, and I was concerned about the Affordable Care Act, privatizing the veteran s administration, the Russian hacking. After he repeatedly tried and failed to speak to his Senator, Good received a cease and desist letter barring him from calling or visiting the premises of any of Johnson s offices.To that end, Temkin s campaign against Johnson was born. For just five dollars, you, too, can have a potato sent to Johnson for his horrible treatment of this constituent who so bravely served our nation in war. Here is Temkin s tweet, complete with a website where you can help with the avalanche of potatoes coming Johnson s way:Senator @RonJohnsonWI is a coward. Please send him a potato for $5: https://t.co/oBAjRrc2TF pic.twitter.com/aWjgtYK15B  Max Temkin (@MaxTemkin) March 3, 2017Temkin and his team further explain their efforts in a blog post on the Cards Against Humanity website:Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) is refusing to hold a town hall meeting with his constituents. When one of his voters, a Vietnam veteran, called his office asking for a town hall, Johnson sent him a cease and desist letter.Legally, we re not allowed to call Senator Johnson a cruel idiot who doesn t understand how health insurance works. But we are allowed to mail thousands of potatoes to his office demanding that he listen to his constituents and hold a town hall meeting.For only $5, you can send a potato with your name on it to Senator Ron Johnson s office demanding that he hold a town hall meeting.Of course, Johnson is just the latest Republican who is being a coward and refusing to do his job and meet with constituents. The man is a disgrace. The least we can do is send him a potato. I think I ll head on over there and do it right now.Featured image via Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images",1
19778,Ethics Complaint Filed Against Rep. Jason Chaffetz for Releasing Comey Clinton Email Letter,"An ethics complaint has been filed against Representative Jason Chaffetz for releasing information provided to him in a letter from FBI Director James Comey. 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump announced the complaint in a statement: 
The Democratic Coalition Against Trump filed a complaint against Representative Jason Chaffetz on Monday morning with the Office of Congressional Ethics for his role in releasing information provided to him by FBI Director James Comey. 
“Representative Chaffetz, in an ill-planned partisan attempt, released information that compromised the integrity of the FBI, when he irresponsibly tweeted out that the case investigating Secretary Clinton’s emails had been reopened, when in fact it had not been. Members of Congress are elected to make our country a safer, better place- not to use their power to work with leaders such as Comey in a partisan fashion. I hope that both are held accountable for their actions,” said Scott Dworkin, Senior Advisor to the Democratic Coalition Against Trump. 
Director Comey is already facing a complaint that was filed with Department of Justic e accusing him of violating the Hatch Act by using his position as a federal employee to influence the outcome of an election. 
The Comey letter couldn’t have gone much worse for Republicans. What the GOP originally hoped was an election shifting moment had become a Republican scandal that Democrats are strongly suggesting will inspiring hearings if they win back the Senate majority . 
Thanks to Chaffetz, House Republicans have already their credibility for future Clinton investigations, a s the Utah Republican’s spin of Comey’s letter was debunked in a matter of hours. 
It’s all gone wrong in short order for Republicans. Comey and Chaffetz are facing complaints, and Hillary Clinton remains on course to be elected the next President Of The United States.",1
55917,"UK business, unions ally to urge Brexit citizenship deal","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s leading business and union bodies jointly urged the British government and European Union on Thursday to guarantee their citizens  rights after Brexit takes place in March 2019. The uncertainty facing four million expatriate European and British citizens has become intolerable, said the heads of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Trades Union Congress (TUC) - who often sit on opposite sides of the corporate negotiating table.  Millions of workers and thousands of firms are today united in their call to leaders on both sides to find an urgent solution,  the CBI s Carolyn Fairbairn and the TUC s Frances O Grady said in a joint statement. The issue of expatriate citizens  rights has become a stumbling block in bilateral talks over Britain s divorce.  Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said concessions made last week by UK Prime Minister Theresa May went in the right direction, but not far enough to move negotiations forward. Describing the current situation as  human poker , Fairbairn and O Grady said  a clear guarantee of the right to remain  for citizens in Britain and the EU was needed within weeks. The CBI and TUC said EU citizens accounted for 10 percent of registered doctors and 4 percent of nurses in Britain.  Millions more work in the public and private sectors delivering public services and making a vital contribution to our economy,  they said. EU citizens giving evidence to a Scottish parliamentary committee on Europe said they had missed job opportunities in the UK due to confusion among employers on the need for a permanent residency card, which costs 160 pounds ($215) and can only be obtained by filling out an 80-page form.  But it is unclear whether the card will be valid post-Brexit when they will then need to apply for  settled status , under proposals currently being discussed. ($1 = 0.7441 pounds) ",0
7347,Living Through the Death of Capitalism,"Living Through the Death of Capitalism Feeling my unborn child as I ponder the death of an economic system By Joe Brewer / medium.com Now is the time to hold strong to our humanity. The world is changing quickly and much is at stake. It is even possible that our entire global civilization will collapse in our lifetime. This is a very difficult concept to sit with — yet sit with it we must, for now is a time of great consequences. A four hundred year old economic system is dying. We can feel the pain all around us. It shivers in the outstretched hands of the homeless. Gets expressed as death rattles in the species going extinct on a daily basis. Entire societies have tattered the social fabric of trust as inequality skyrocketed in the last few decades. It is experienced as fear, anger, sadness, humiliation, shame, and despair. Every person alive today has a responsibility to bear witness, provide hospice care to the dying, and participate in midwifing new ways to structure social life. This is our burden to be alive in the early part of the 21st Century. Yet so many among us are still behaving like children. They call each other names. Pick fights between parochial tribal groups. Bitch and moan when things don’t go their way. And hoard precious wealth in a time of increasing global scarcity. Now is the time to behave like grownups. Because the threats now upon us are very serious. I say this as a man who is about to become a father. My wife and I chose — with eyes wide open — to bring a child into this world in the midst of great upheaval. We believe deeply and firmly in humanity and are investing our blood in the future. This is not something we do lightly. It is a great responsibility to continue the human race even as billions starve and there now lurks a very real possibility that our child will live through the collapse of the Earth’s first globalized civilization. This unborn child has prospects to live into the 22nd Century. What will be seen through their eyes? Will there be a saga of unraveling the biosphere for our precious home planet? Might the death throes of capitalism take down the safety nets of a stable climate? Will our child bear witness to the final days of humanity? We cannot say even how long his or her survival will be secure. Yet we carry forth knowing what must be done. Humanity is in the crucible of change now. It is an all-hands-on-deck transition — away from life destroying economic practices based on wealth hoarding and extraction and toward life affirming practices of regeneration and renewal. Let me state this seriously and succinctly. According to the Stockholm Resilience Institute, there are nine “planetary boundaries” that represent thresholds for a viable global civilization. Cross even one and the entire edifice will fall into ruin. While there remains uncertainty about where these thresholds are, the best scientific evidence available today tells us that we have probably already crossed four of them. We are currently in overshoot and collapse . There are time lags in the system so the unraveling may not happen until the middle of this century. Instead of thinking about putting our child through college in 20 years, we must grapple with scenarios of tremendous upheaval and disruption. They will need to be a survivalist and servant to others in need. Notions of stable careers and long-term planning may never be a possibility in this child’s life. I write these words not out of despair, but as an affirmation of the most rugged hopefulness I can muster. I was trained in climate science and I know what is coming. I have studied the rise and fall of empires so I am aware that fascist dictators and resource wars are likely to arise in the turmoil of the coming decades. Yet still I gently touch the swollen belly of my wife and feel our baby kicking and turning in her womb. I have felt the heartbeat of a new life and will do all I can to ensure that humanity makes it through to the other side. This is what it feels like to live through the death of capitalism. Eyes wide open even if tears may well up in them. I look to the horizon where shimmers of beautiful alternatives await. It doesn’t have to be like this. We can do better. We must do better. In truth, there are already hundreds of millions of people actively struggling against the wealth extracting juggernaut that is Western development — expressed as colonialism in early years, then later in the various forms of trade agreements, structural debt repayment programs, illicit resource wars fueled by propaganda, and the full apparatus of wealth extraction that is in place today. We needn’t wonder why a mere 60 people have the same aggregate wealth as 4 billion. This is an outcome designed into the core logic of extraction that arises when private owners extract rents (what is commonly called profits) from the valuable labor of other people. It only took four hundred years for this system to run itself out. What no one could have predicted then was that the human population would explode and our fingerprints on the Earth would grow from tiny scratches here and there to deep scars that can be viewed from space. This is our legacy as a species right now. It is the bed we have prepared for our own children and grandchildren to lie down in. And it is our responsibility to carry through the dark times we are now in so that future generations can thrive in whatever ways make sense to them. I am with you, fellow humans. I believe in us. Let us not fall into despair or acquiesce as extremism rears its ugly head around the world — as it did recently in the United States . For it will be the beacons of light we carry that will show others the way forward. For my part, I am working with social movements to connect the dots of wealth extraction and training change makers in the art and science of intentional social change. I have seen with my own eyes that millions of peasant farmers are organizing across Latin America and India; students are protesting outrageous debt in Mexico, Greece, and Spain; indigenous peoples are coming together across the North American continent to protect their sacred lands. We are gathering our strength for the collective transition. Of the 7.4 billion humans alive today, several hundred million are already organizing to drive the system to change. There is much to be hopeful about in this struggle. We each have a role to play. And time is of the essence. Onward, fellow humans. Want to support Joe Brewer's work?

50709,Qatar builds dairy industry in desert as it defies Arab boycott,"UMM AL HAWAYA, Qatar (Reuters) - Deep in the Qatari desert, a herd of cows stands in a vast shed, cooled by fans and jets of mist - each animal a key player in a plan to defy a trade boycott and make the kingdom self-sufficient in milk by next year. The black and white Holstein cattle are among the first members of a 14,000-strong herd that farming company Baladna is expecting to build up in coming months, its chief executive John Dore told Reuters in an interview.  We will make Qatar self-sufficient by June - that is the target,  Dore said. He conceded that raising and milking cows in temperatures nearing 50 degrees Celsius (120 Fahrenheit) in summer posed special challenges. But technology and the deep pockets of Baladna s Qatari owners were compensating for the harsh environment, said Dore, an Irishman who previously worked for Saudi Arabian dairy giant Almarai. Hundreds of cows were already hooked up to the automatic milking machines at Baladna s farm in Umm al Hawaya, about 50 km (30 miles) north of Doha, and producing milk good enough to export, he said. More than 6,000 more cows from the United States are due to arrive by February. Qatar s drive to build a dairy industry in the desert illustrates how the tiny but wealthy country, the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, is using money and technology to cope with its isolation. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut trade and transport ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of backing terrorism, a charge which Doha denies.  The boycott disrupted Qatar s shipping routes through the Gulf. It also shut Qatar s land border with Saudi Arabia, across which many perishable goods were imported, including almost 400 tonnes of fresh milk and yoghurt a day. The boycott has forced Qatar to fly in dairy products from Turkey and Iran. But Dore said the country was determined to create its own dairy sector, largely relying on Baladna, a private company which is receiving logistical and other support from the government. The firm, which raises sheep, was considering moving into milk production before the boycott, but knew it would find it hard to compete on price with imports from Almarai, he said.  The boycott removed that competition and in the initial weeks of the diplomatic crisis, the company flew in the first 3,400 cows on state-owned airline Qatar Airways.  We were milking cows here on the 11th of July, which is barely a month after the blockade, and that by any method or means is some achievement,  Dore said. Baladna is planning two more sea shipments from the United States - each holding 3,300 animals - by February. Another consignment of 3,000 cows has been planned, but not yet ordered. By June, it says it is expecting to raise production of fresh milk and yoghurt to 500 tonnes a day, enough to meet domestic demand with 100 tonnes left over for export. Baladna has not disclosed financial details of its project, and it is not yet clear whether Qatar can produce large volumes of milk economically, let alone export some at competitive prices. But for now at least, the country s drive to reduce its dependence on imports with domestic production appears to be stimulating the economy. The manufacturing sector grew 3.2 percent from a year earlier in September, official data released last week showed. Food manufacturing jumped 23.5 percent. ",0
45750,"Ex-Trump staffer sues campaign, alleges gun incident in North Carolina","(Reuters) - A former North Carolina staffer is suing Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, saying a top employee in the state working on the Republican’s White House bid once pulled a gun on him and that after he reported it, the campaign took no action. Vincent Bordini, who said he was hired in December 2015 as a software trainer, said Earl Phillip, then Trump’s North Carolina state director, pointed a pistol at his kneecap while the two were in a car together in February, according to a lawsuit dated Wednesday and filed in state court. Bordini said he reported the incident to several Trump campaign officials, including then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, with no result, according to the lawsuit, which was posted online by the New York Daily News. The lawsuit names Phillip and the Trump campaign as defendants. “Vincent was a passionate Donald J. Trump supporter,” the lawsuit said. “He had faith that the Trump campaign would handle the situation internally. But as time went on it became apparent  that this not going to happen.” William Harding, a Charlotte-based lawyer for Phillip, called the allegations “preposterous” and said if Bordini’s claims were true, there would have been criminal action. “If someone brandished a weapon on me or assaults me, I’m going to go to the appropriate law enforcement officer,” Harding said. Phillip was replaced earlier this month as state director and moved to a diversity coalition for Trump. On Thursday, he resigned from the campaign, Harding said. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Bordini also did not immediately respond. The lawsuit said the gun incident occurred during a trip to South Carolina ahead of that state’s primary. Bordini said four other people had similar interactions with Phillip, but the campaign did nothing in response, the lawsuit said. ",0
13952,"Conservatives Already Plotting To Block Clinton’s SCOTUS Picks, Let Court ‘Die Out’","By Sean Colarossi on Wed, Oct 26th, 2016 at 8:34 pm Not even an overwhelming victory by Hillary Clinton is likely to convince Republicans that they should do their job. Share on Twitter Print This Post 
Since Republicans have essentially conceded that Donald Trump is going to lose the general election to Hillary Clinton, they’re already making plans in the event that she decides to do her job and nominate Supreme Court justices. 
According to a report from the Huffington Post on Wednesday, one conservative thinker says that John McCain’s recent suggestion that his party should block any nominee put forward by Clinton isn’t that farfetched. 
The report: 
Some conservatives certainly seem to be warming up to McCain’s controversial suggestion last week that Senate Republicans should dig in their heels and block any and all Supreme Court nominees put forth by a future President Hillary Clinton. 
Who needs a fully functioning Supreme Court after all? 
“As a matter of constitutional law, the Senate is fully within its powers to let the Supreme Court die out, literally,” wrote the Cato Institute’s Ilya Shapiro in a column Wednesday on The Federalist. 
Shapiro is well-versed in constitutional issues, and his argument has a legal, if contorted, basis. Nothing in the Constitution explicitly stands in the way of senators who would be willing to destroy the nation’s highest court ― if not an entire branch of the federal government ― to stop Clinton from selecting judges who share her views. 
… 
To Shapiro, there’s nothing wrong with even more Senate obstructionism because “the Constitution is completely silent” on how the upper chamber provides its “advice and consent” on the president’s nominees. 
… 
“So when you get past the gotcha headlines, breathless reportage, and Inauguration Day, if Hillary Clinton is president it would be completely decent, honorable, and in keeping with the Senate’s constitutional duty to vote against essentially every judicial nominee she names,” he concluded. 
The original argument from Republicans was that they would block President Obama’s Supreme Court appointment until voters had a chance to weigh in via the Nov. 8 election. Forget the fact that this isn’t how the constitutional system is meant to operate, but that was their reasoning. 
Now, faced with the growing prospect that Hillary Clinton will be elected the 45th President of the United States, they are beginning to change their tune. 
The obstruction that defined the Republican Party throughout Obama’s presidency looks like it will be sticking around after he is gone. It’s yet another reason why down-ballot races are more critical than ever this year.",1
57521,Azeri court releases head of independent Azeri news agency,"BAKU (Reuters) - An Azeri court on Monday released the director of an independent news agency from pre-trial detention but said an investigation of him can continue, in a case condemned by human rights activists. Mehman Aliyev, the head of Turan news agency, was detained by Azeri police in the capital, Baku, on Aug. 24, on suspicion of tax evasion and illegal business activities. Investigation of those allegations will continue Turan suspended its operations from Sept. 1.  I m not under arrest anymore. I consider this decision as positive ... I m glad that mistake has been amended,  Aliyev told Reuters by telephone after his release. Azeri officials said Aliyev s release was a demonstration of the president s attitude to journalists.  His release is a proof of President (Ilham) Aliyev s special attitude to journalists and mass media,  said Aflatun Amashov, the head of Azerbaijan s Press Union. The West has criticized Azerbaijan for what it calls  intimidation and repression aimed at the opposition and urged Baku to comply with its pledges on human rights. Azeri officials deny the accusations. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as well as opposition parties in Azerbaijan and human rights activists had been calling for Aliyev s immediate release. ",0
37448,Republicans join push to lift secrecy around misconduct in Congress,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prominent Republican senators on Thursday embraced a push to overhaul rules for addressing sexual harassment in the U.S. Congress, signing on to a bill that would protect victims and require lawmakers to pay for their own settlements. The legislation builds on demands to lift the veil of secrecy around sexual harassment and misconduct on Capitol Hill, and has gained steam in recent months as a wave of women have come forward with accusations against prominent American men in politics, media and entertainment. The bipartisan push signaled momentum in the Republican-led U.S. Congress for overhauling a process for handling misconduct allegations that many lawmakers say is antiquated and stacked against victims. The Senate bill, called the Congressional Harassment Reform Act, draws from proposals that Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Jackie Speier, both Democrats, have been developing. “Congress is really behind the eight-ball. I think that, in many respects, the private sector has acted more swiftly than we have in terms of addressing sexual harassment,” Speier said in an interview. High-profile Republican senators co-sponsoring the bill include John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican; Ted Cruz; Joni Ernst and Lisa Murkowski. The legislation would require any member of Congress found liable for harassment to pay settlements themselves, rather than with taxpayer funds, as the current process allows. “Congress is not above the laws, and secret settlements with taxpayer money to cover up harassment should no longer be tolerated,” Cruz said in a statement. Settlements would be made public automatically unless victims choose to keep them private. Outrage over sexual misconduct in politics helped to fuel an upset victory by Democrat Doug Jones in the U.S. Senate race in deeply conservative Alabama on Tuesday. Voters rejected the Republican candidate in the race, Roy Moore, who had been accused by multiple women of pursuing them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, including one woman who said he tried to initiate sexual contact with her when she was 14. Moore denied the allegations but many prominent Republicans distanced themselves from Moore, although President Donald Trump backed him. In Washington, allegations of sexual misconduct prompted the resignations last week of three lawmakers - Democratic Senator Al Franken, Democratic Representative John Conyers and Republican Representative Trent Franks. On Tuesday, Republican Representative Blake Farenthold said he would not seek re-election in November. Politico reported that the congressional Office of Compliance had paid $84,000 from a public fund on behalf of Farenthold to settle a sexual harassment claim in 2015. Reuters has been unable to verify the allegations against Farenthold, who has said that the charges were false and has denied wrongdoing. The 1995 law governing the process for complaints in Congress - created in the wake of a harassment scandal - has been criticized as ineffective. The lengthy and cumbersome process requires victims to go through mandatory mediation and requires complete secrecy. “It created a protective blanket around the harasser and left the victim out in the cold,” Speier said. Speier, who has worked on the issue since 2014, came forward in October with her own story of unwanted sexual contact from the chief of staff for the lawmaker she worked for as a congressional aide. “He kissed me and stuck his tongue in my mouth,” said Speier, who has become a resource from women seeking advice on how to handle similar situations. “When it happened to me, it disgusted me. I kind of recoiled.” Speier’s proposals for reforms have attracted support from more than 100 members, including 19 Republicans. A group of conservative Republicans have championed a separate bill focused on banning the use of taxpayer dollars for settlements, and requiring past settlements to be disclosed and reimbursed. “What we do agree is that taxpayers should not be on the hook for misbehavior and for those settlements that are made,” said Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative who has advocated for the proposal. “We need to use that to make certain that workplaces are respectful,” Blackburn said in an interview. A House committee is reviewing reforms with an eye to making recommendations in coming weeks. “I think that what we are doing is taking the best of all the ideas out there and putting them into one package,” a senior House Republican aide said.

There are also protests across the country and a risk of terrorist groups linked to organized crime rings smuggling arms and fake documents.  This was a realistic exercise and an opportunity to demonstrate that we have capacities, power and determination to quickly and efficiently respond to any security threat,  said Bosnia s Security Minister Dragan Mektic. More than 20 years since the end of its war in the 1990s, Bosnia is still troubled by ethnic politicking and external influences. While separatist aspirations by the Bosnian Serb and Croat nationalists grow stronger, there is also a threat of radicalization among traditionally moderate Bosnian Muslims.  The five-day drill, by the 600- strong EUFOR along with 400 British and NATO troops, also includes reconnaissance and surveillance of wide areas across Bosnia. In 2015, parts of Bosnia were hit by the greatest flooding in a century, leaving thousands without homes and hurting the economy. The same year, two soldiers and a police officer were killed in separate terrorist attacks.  EUFOR was deployed in Bosnia in late 2004, replacing NATO s SFOR force to maintain security after the 1992-95 war. Its mandate has been repeatedly extended.     While Bosnia s central authorities want to join NATO, Bosnian Serbs, who prefer stronger ties with Russia, oppose that and have threatened to hold a referendum on the issue. ",0

4131,"Donald Trump triumphs in Michigan and Mississippi. Onward, reality show junkies","Donald Trump has absorbed more attacks in the last two weeks from his opponents, their super PACs and the Republican establishment than any candidate I've seen in my five decades around presidential politics.

The ""shock and awe"" attack of unfriendly fire seems to have had minimum impact on his candidacy as he won two big victories Tuesday night in Mississippi and Michigan. Big Don is still standing and the establishment favorite, little Marco got routed -- finishing out of money in both contests.

Ted Cruz, who came in second in both races in Michigan and Mississippi and won Idaho, keeps fighting to remain relevant. He is having a tough time reaching beyond the evangelical base which he splits with Trump. But the finals of this election cycle could come down to Trump versus Cruz.

John Kasich came in a distant second to Trump in his neighboring state which may bode poorly for his showdown next week in Ohio, the state he governs.

Rubio is on death watch and life support and can't survive if he doesn't win his home state of Florida. Tuesday night's poor showing is not going to encourage the money guys to bet more on him and he faces a real uphill battle to beat Trump in the billionaire’s adopted state of Florida.

Trump’s battle cry ""I love Florida and they love me!"" will be tested in seven days in the first of the winner take all states. There will be no more second place finishes or silver medals. Win or lose is now the rule of the game.

We have now seen the travelogue of the Trump properties and golf courses, suffered through a full display of all his products from vodka to steaks and the men's accessories made in China.

Tuesday’s night’s Trump victory speech/press conference was like a lengthy sales pitch on Home Shopping Network.

I've never before seen a press conference in which the press is hollering ""Stop, please stop! No mas, no mas!"" No more questions, please!!”

Donald's hour long tirade and rambling speech was his revenge for the assault on him by the billionaires and their political consultants who have puffed and puffed but can't blow Donald's house down.

Onward, reality show junkies. This show is a long way from being over!

Maybe the only thing that can slow the Donald down is ""House of Cards"" Frank Underwood. Of course his presidency is in trouble, too. But this reality show is stranger than fiction!

52741,Australian PM to force lawmakers to declare citizenship to end political crisis,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced plans on Monday to force all lawmakers to declare they are not dual nationals as he seeks to defuse a political crisis that saw his deputy ejected from parliament.  Turnbull s center-right coalition government was thrown into disarray last month when the High Court ruled that five lawmakers who were dual nationals, including Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, were ineligible for parliament. The Australian leader has been facing down calls since for a full audit of parliamentarians to ensure they comply with the country s constitution, which bars foreign nationals from sitting in parliament to prevent split allegiances.  The High Court ruling expelled three members of the Liberal-National coalition government from parliament, while a fourth resigned days later after confirming he also had dual nationality. The other affected lawmakers were from minority parties, with the main opposition Labor Party yet to be ensnared. Turnbull said his plan, unlike an audit, would put the onus on lawmakers to check their own situation and anybody found to have made a false declaration would be in contempt of parliament. Lawmakers will be required to produce documents to prove any second citizenship has been renounced.   Members and senators have been put squarely on notice now and so they will be turning their mind to their own affairs and the issues of citizenship,  Turnbull told reporters in Canberra. The new laws would apply to both existing and prospective lawmakers. Those already in parliament would be given 21 days to make a declaration from the date it comes into force, while new lawmakers would have the same period of time from their swearing in.  Turnbull said he hoped to push the changes through parliament in the last remaining sitting days this year. That will require support from the Labor Party, which suggested a similar plan last week.  Turnbull has said previously that the court s interpretation of the constitution was  very strict . He has flagged potential changes to the constitution, noting that more than half of Australia s population of 24 million was either born overseas or has a parent who was born overseas. A referendum would be needed to change the constitution. All seven lawmakers in the High Court case, two of whom were cleared to remain in parliament, accepted that they were dual nationals at the time of their election but claimed they were unaware of their status. Some were conferred a second nationality by birth, others by descent.  ",0
11094,China’s Growing Amphibious Capabilities (Part 1),"Syrian War Report – November 2, 2016: ISIS and Al-Nusra Attempt to Cut Off Govt Supply Line to Aleppo ‹ › South Front Analysis & Intelligence is a public analytical project maintained by an independent team of experts from the four corners of the Earth focusing on international relations issues and crises. They focus on analysis and intelligence of the ongoing crises and the biggest stories from around the world: Ukraine, the war in Middle East, Central Asia issues, protest movements in the Balkans, migration crises, and others. In addition, they provide military operations analysis, the military posture of major world powers, and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations. We try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media. China’s Growing Amphibious Capabilities (Part 1) By South Front on November 3, 2016 …from SouthFront 
This is the first part of the military analysis of China’s amphibious capabilities and their influence on the balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region. The second part of the analysis will be released next week. 
The Chinese government has achieved a great deal in terms of modernizing and increasing the capabilities of its armed forces in the past two decades and they are quickly obtaining parity with their counterparts in the West. China has made great strides along the long road to rebuild its military, so that it can compete and excel in the modern battlespace. Much has been written about the fledgling PLAN aircraft carrier program. With one conventional aircraft carrier in service, the Liaoning , and a second carrier being built, China has obviously made the commitment to acquire at least a small aircraft carrier strike capability. 
Another important development, perhaps less sensational and headline catching than aircraft carriers, is the growth and modernization of the amphibious capabilities of both the PLA and PLAN. Chinese military strategists realize that naval power, including naval aviation, can project power and can also provide China with the more subtle, yet very effective means of naval power presence in the region. The presence of Chinese naval power in the region can be leveraged to influence advantage in political struggles with its neighbors. Neither naval presence, nor naval power and naval air power can take (or retake) and hold ground, and thus China has decided that a modern and capable amphibious force of sufficient size is a necessary component of its overall maritime strategy. It is significant that this force has doubled in size over the past five years and has been equipped with new, high-tech weaponry and the beginnings of a viable sealift component that can carry it to battle. 
The beginnings of the Chinese interest in amphibious warfare dates back to the Korean War and the Peoples Republic of China’s efforts to defeat the Kuomintang in the 1950s. In 1953, the PLA established the PLA Marine Corps (PLAMC). Although comprising of two brigades of approximately 6,000 officers and men, the PLAMC have undergone a continuous transformation since the Taiwan Strait Crises of the 1990s. The force has been equipped with China’s most modern and capable small arms and equipment, and utilizes the new generation of ZBD05/ZBD2000 amphibious assault vehicles. In some ways modeled on the USMC, the PLAMC marines are highly trained in all forms of modern warfighting. They are considered a vital component of China’s rapid reaction forces, and are thus highly mobile and kept on a heightened state of readiness. 
The current force structure of the PLAMC is of two brigades, the 1 st Marine Brigade and 164 th Marine Brigade. Each brigade consists of one armored regiment and two marine battalions and various support elements. The PLAMC relies on the high speed of its ZBD05/2000 series vehicles to carry them from offshore amphibious platforms such as the Type 071 LPD. The ZBD05 is the world’s fastest armored amphibious assault vehicle, capable of a top speed of 45kph (27mph) in the water. In addition, PLA marines are skilled in air assault operations, small boat assaults and underwater diving operations. 
Although the PLAMC represents a very potent amphibious assault and rapid reaction force, the Chinese political and military leadership realized years ago, that the force is too small to respond to multiple threats across the full scope of China’s maritime boundaries, nor large enough to mount a successful invasion of Taiwan. A viable power projection capability in the form of amphibious assault and air assault forces is seen as essential in protecting the nation’s interests in Africa, the Indian Ocean, South China Sea and East China Sea, especially as it is confronted by U.S. attempts to contain it. 
Starting in 2014, the Chinese high command decided to expand the two established Amphibious Mechanized Infantry Divisions (AMID) to four. The 1 st and 86 th AMIDs are based in the Nanjing Military Region (Eastern Command), and the 123 rd and 124 th AMIDs are based in the Guangzhou Military Region (Southern Command). Each division is comparable to a mechanized infantry division in size and establishment. The expansion of the AMIDs gives the PLA a greater amphibious capability that might be required in the near future in deterring regional challenges to Chinese territorial claims in both the South and East China Seas, and providing a viable response to violations of its territorial integrity. 
None of China’s potential adversaries in the region, other than the United States Navy, have a comparable amphibious warfare force. When combined with the PLAMC, the AMIDS give Chinese diplomacy a very robust practical demonstration of force. Regularly held amphibious exercises showcasing the growing aptitude of these forces only reinforce this reality. Perhaps the most obvious challenges facing the marines and AMIDs, and a major shortcoming that is in the process of remedy, is the lack of heavy sealift capability to transport these units over long sea voyages and within striking range of their theoretical targets.

45744,California lawmaker to float zero emissions vehicle bill,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A California lawmaker next week will introduce a bill requiring 15 percent of all vehicles sold in the state to be emissions-free by 2025, her spokeswoman said on Friday. Assemblywoman Autumn Burke says the legislation is needed to ensure that California’s current zero emissions vehicle target is met with actual vehicles and not just clean car credits, which environmentalists claim have flooded the market.  “Governor (Jerry) Brown has set an ambitious goal of 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025, but unless we take action, the state won’t come close to meeting this goal,” said Burke, who represents the city of Inglewood in car-centric Los Angeles county.  “That’s why we need to reform the rules to require that 15 percent of all cars sold in California have zero emissions by 2025. This is about clean cars, not credits,” she said in a statement to Reuters. The bill will require the California Air Resources Board to adopt a regulation by the end of next year to reach the 15 percent goal.  CARB has for years operated a zero emission vehicles program, which has helped the state achieve its current level of about 200,000 ZEVs on the road. But a complex system of clean car credits, designed to give automakers flexibility in meeting the sales target, has led to a glut of credits, according to experts.  Environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and electric car manufacturer Tesla Motors told CARB at a recent meeting that auto companies may be able to reach the state’s target by simply submitting credits, and said changes to the program’s credit system are required. About 4 percent of vehicles sold in California are zero emissions vehicles, which include full battery electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and plug-in hybrids. The NRDC estimates that under the current rules and credit system, California would  have only 6 percent of all vehicles emission-free by 2025.   ",0

4997,G.O.P.’s Moneyed Class Finds Its Place in New Trump World - The New York Times,"CLEVELAND  —   In his unlikely rise to the Republican nomination Donald J. Trump attacked lobbyists, disparaged big donors and railed against the party’s establishment. But on the shores of Lake Erie this week, beyond the glare of television cameras, the power of the permanent political class seemed virtually undisturbed. Though Mr. Trump promises to topple Washington’s “rigged system,” the opening rounds of his party’s quadrennial meeting accentuated a more enduring maxim: Money always adapts to power. At a downtown barbecue joint, lobbyists cheerfully passed out stickers reading “Make Lobbying Great Again” as they schmoozed on Monday with Republican ambassadors, lawmakers and executives. At a windowless bar tucked behind the   hotel, whose rooms were set aside for the party’s most generous benefactors, allies of Mr. Trump pitched a clutch of receptive party donors on contributing to a   “super PAC. ” And on Tuesday night, as Republican delegates formally made Mr. Trump their   presidential nominee, a few dozen lobbyists and their clients instead sipped gin and munched on Brie puffs in an   room at the Union Club. They had come to witness a more urgent presentation: Newt Gingrich, a top Trump adviser and Beltway fixture, painting an upbeat picture of the deals they could help sculpt on infrastructure projects and military spending in the first hundred days of a Trump administration. “It is the business of Washington,” said Michael J. Anderson, a Democratic lobbyist who represents American Indian tribes, after watching Mr. Gingrich speak. “Mr. Trump is talking about changing the paradigm. It’s not changing one bit. The political and influence class is going on as before. ” In Cleveland, even some of those who had worked against Mr. Trump’s candidacy now saw opportunity. In dozens of private receptions, behind a scrim of barricades and police officers, they inspected their party’s new Trump faction with curiosity and hope. There were spheres of influence to carve out. There was money to raise and money to be made, whether or not Mr. Trump ended up in the White House. There were new friends to make and old relationships to nurture. “This is an event like no other  —   there are governors, senators, members of Congress,” said Eric J. Tanenblatt, a longtime ally of the Bush family whose law firm, Dentons, hosted Mr. Gingrich’s remarks on Tuesday. “For people who operate in and around government, you can’t not be here. ” And so, far above the din of protesters and delegates, on the 49th floor of the Key Tower, Squire Patton Boggs, a lobbying and legal powerhouse, held packed receptions honoring Ohio and Florida officials. Not far away, Mike Leavitt, the former Utah governor turned consultant for pharmaceutical companies and health insurers, was slated to lead a panel on policies to spur the development of prescription drugs. As Speaker Paul D. Ryan helped tamp down   efforts on the convention floor, his political operation ran a daily series of receptions and hospitality lounges for members of the “Speaker’s Council,” the top donors to House Republicans. “You have these two worlds colliding a little bit here,” said David Tamasi, a lobbyist at the firm Rasky Baerlein and a top Republican   on K Street, who joined Mr. Trump’s team after his preferred candidate, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, went down to defeat. “That’s what’s going to be interesting: How do the establishment guys make those folks feel at home?” They are doing so, in part, by footing the bill. While some of the party’s elite donors have shunned Mr. Trump’s coronation this week, they are still paying for it. Roughly 500 wealthy Republicans poured close to $16 million into the Republican National Committee’s convention account leading up to this week, according to disclosures made to the Federal Election Commission through last Friday. The biggest donors, giving more than $100, 000 each, are also a veritable roll call of the   movement, among them the billionaire investor Paul E. Singer and Marlene Ricketts, who bankrolled early efforts to deny Mr. Trump the nomination. Mr. Singer did not attend, though his political advisers made the rounds in Cleveland, as did representatives for other megadonors who remain opposed to Mr. Trump. And there were growing signs that at least some of the party’s biggest givers were warming to him:   of Monday’s super PAC reception at the   included Harold Hamm, a billionaire oil tycoon and former energy adviser to Mitt Romney, and Stanley Hubbard, a Minnesota television station owner and prominent donor. Among the guests was Foster Friess, the   mutual fund investor and super PAC donor, who expressed optimism at his party’s prospects. “I think it could be a landslide,” Mr. Friess said in an interview. “Donald Trump has the ability to reach all the plumbers and carpenters and factory workers who usually vote Democratic. ” Mr. Trump, of course, remains unpopular among many Republican donors, and it is unclear how many will ultimately open their wallets to help fund his campaign. Some events were more sparsely attended than they would have been four years ago, Republicans said. It was a little easier to get tickets to concerts in Cleveland, a little easier to get bumped up to the premium hotel rooms. And there is no question that Mr. Trump’s blasts against unfettered trade and Wall Street banks have unsettled powerful business interests  —   and are now, to some extent, reflected in the party’s own DNA. In recent days, Trump activists have helped install new planks in the party platform calling for tougher trade negotiations and for reinstating the   Act, the   law that walled commercial banking off from investment banking. Yet those same power brokers won a more consequential victory even before the convention started, when Mr. Trump’s team helped them quash a rule proposed by some conservative delegates that would have banned lobbyists from serving as Republican National Committee members. The proposal by supporters of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas pitted Tea Party conservatives against the party’s business wing the conservative delegates were soundly defeated. “It is disappointing,” said Mary Anne Kinney, a New Hampshire state representative and Cruz delegate, who was among those who pushed for the ban. “Some of us had heard things that maybe Donald Trump was not a fan of the lobbyists. They are not always for the interest of the people. ” In fact, many of them are for the interests of Mr. Trump, at least this week. Among the floor whips prowling the convention floor in Cleveland in neon yellow baseball caps, managing and corralling delegates, were a number of volunteers from Washington government affairs firms or Capitol Hill. Many had supported other candidates during the primary. Now they were working for their party’s nominee. One of them was Robert Hoffman, a Republican lobbyist at Heather Podesta and Partners. Earlier in the week, the firm hosted a barbecue brunch for friends and delegates, where Mr. Hoffman and his colleagues handed out “Make Lobbying Great Again” stickers. Mr. Hoffman seemed to see Mr. Trump’s policy agenda more in terms of possibilities than threats. The convention, he noted, was a chance to learn more about Mr. Trump’s   plans, and perhaps to help shape them. “We want to be a sounding board,” Mr. Hoffman said. “Not just for our clients, but for our campaign. ”",0

But her voice begins to falter when she talks about her own life  —   how years of exploitation shattered her confidence and turned her life upside down. “For many years, I couldn’t talk about being an addict,” she said. “I couldn’t talk about being imprisoned. I couldn’t talk about getting on my feet, getting my life back, getting my children back. ” She paused to fight back tears. “I could not talk about that part of me where I was victimized. ” But having realized that airline employees are perfectly positioned to stop human traffickers and their victims in transit, Ms. Hubbard has found her mission: teaching other flight attendants to spot and report cases of human trafficking. The nonprofit organization she joined in 2015, Airline Ambassadors International, trains workers at airlines and airports how to spot, and report, cases of human trafficking. It also delivers humanitarian aid around the world and transports sick children who need medical care. It was founded in 1996 by Nancy Rivard, who was then a flight attendant. “We just did it on our own as a public service because we had the   personnel,” Ms. Rivard said, noting that the organization began focusing on human trafficking in 2009 and has held 52 training sessions in the United States and abroad since 2011. There were 8, 042 reported cases of human trafficking in the United States last year  —   the most ever, according to a report released last week by the nonprofit organization Polaris. Most of those came through calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which was established by the federal government in December 2007 and is operated by Polaris in a   partnership. The number of reported cases has been rising every year since the hotline was established. But it is not all bad news, said Bradley Myles, Polaris’s chief executive. “We don’t necessarily want to give the impression that just because we’re learning about more cases, the crime is increasing,” Mr. Myles said. “It’s actually possible that the response is getting more sophisticated. ” Encouragingly, he added, more and more of these reports are coming directly from trafficking victims, which suggests a growing awareness among those who need it most that the hotline exists. Ms. Hubbard sees victim outreach as vital to her work, but she is hesitant to give details about her own ordeal. She entered an arranged marriage at 16, she said, but the worst abuses did not start until her early 20s, when she described being “bought and sold, traded and bartered. ” “Usually, the traffickers play on people’s ignorance and naïveté,” she said. “Traffickers exploit people who are vulnerable. ” That is part of the lesson she imparts to airline personnel, along with practical advice on how to spot people who may be traveling against their will  —   often young passengers who look disoriented, refuse to make eye contact or act oddly subservient to a traveling companion. American Airlines, Ms. Rivard’s former employer, offers free miles to the volunteers of Airline Ambassadors International. American’s employees already undergo training on human trafficking, led by the Department of Homeland Security, according to a company representative. Ms. Rivard said airlines’ existing programs are not enough. She cited instances in which she said airline staff failed to take signs of trafficking seriously, and added that she wished more resources were available to her organization. “It doesn’t cost much. We try to raise about $3, 000 per training” from individual donors, she said. An Airline Ambassadors International training session in late January in Houston, just before the Super Bowl there, was filled to capacity. “It was an amazing event,” Ms. Hubbard said. “I give kudos to the city of Houston and to the agencies that are doing the work on the ground. ” Though human trafficking gets more attention during major sporting events like the Super Bowl, there is little hard evidence  —   from Polaris or elsewhere  —   to suggest a major spike in trafficking during large events. “We don’t think it’s useful to somehow give the impression that there are new victims and new types of trafficking that only happen around that time,” Mr. Myles said, though he added that major events might lure criminals who were already operating in other areas. The Houston Police Department has been revamping its approach to human trafficking for years, said Capt. Dan Harris, of the department’s vice division. It now offers training on human trafficking for officers as well as assistance for survivors. “We had the processes, the procedures and the relationships already in place,” Captain Harris said. “The only thing we really did for the Super Bowl was work more hours in order to go after, mainly, the johns. ” While law enforcement agencies and charities work to address the problem on the ground, Ms. Hubbard and other flight attendants plan to keep an eye on things in the air. “If someone is being held against their will, then a crime is being committed inside my airplane,” she said. “So it is my responsibility to make sure that these people  —   whose lives are in my hands while they’re on board my aircraft  —   are safe. ”",0
12556,"From ‘Pitch Perfect’ to Broadway, He’s Vocal About A Cappella - The New York Times","“You can hear a whoosh of air as the train approaches,” Deke Sharon said, breaking down the cacophony on a subway platform into its component parts. “There’s the high screech of the tires, and underneath it all there’s a low rumble. ” For good measure, he emulated each sound. Mr. Sharon may be as perky as you might imagine the   “guru of a cappella” to be, but little can prepare you for his infectious good cheer. “This is me mellow!” he exclaimed with boundless enthusiasm  —   a mood even more striking considering he was waiting for a C train in the chaotically busy 42nd Street station. Looking fetchingly   in a blazer and jeans, he showed no sign of the stress that comes with opening a rather unconventional Broadway show. As if travel to workshops, camps, master classes, concerts and recording studios, as well as overseeing the touring group Vocalosity, weren’t enough, Mr. Sharon has spent the past few months on the vocal arrangements for “In Transit. ” It’s the first a cappella musical on Broadway, created by a quartet of songwriters including Kristen   a   of songs for the animated film “Frozen. ” The short commute from his temporary Manhattan apartment to the Circle in the Square Theater, where “In Transit” is in previews, constituted field research for Mr. Sharon, as the show’s characters all cross paths on the subway. “I would come down here and listen,” said Mr. Sharon, a tall and lanky Bay Area resident. “But I also wanted to get a sense of the relationship between people, because a cappella is about the interconnectedness of voices and individuals. ” This last point is the crux of what Mr. Sharon, 48, calls his lifelong mission of creating harmony through harmony. To that end he leaves no outlet unturned. His   jobs have included serving as executive producer, coach and arranger on the NBC reality show “The  ” (which spawned the hugely successful vocal group Pentatonix) and writing the arrangements for both “Pitch Perfect” movies. In the second film, he also sang many of the backup harmonies for the villainous   team Das Sound Machine and had a cameo as a German judge. Mr. Sharon has created a cappella arrangements for about 2, 000 songs and has written several books, including the new “The Heart of Vocal Harmony. ” So when time came to retool “In Transit” for a bigger stage after an Off Broadway run in 2010, Ms.   and her   immediately thought of him. “We were really into ‘The ’ and of course we knew Deke was in the House Jacks, which was the first big professional,   a cappella group,” Ms.   who sang in a vocal group at Williams College, said in a phone interview. Mr. Sharon was a   of the House Jacks in 1991, with singers he had met on the college circuit. It was a bold move at a time when a cappella was not popular, aside from freak hits like Bobby McFerrin’s “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” and Boyz II Men’s “It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday. ” Yet in hindsight, Mr. Sharon had the background and dedication required to take a cappella to the next level. This, after all, is someone who says he could sing before he could talk and whose parents signed him for a church choir at the ripe age of 5. He later participated in musical theater but had an a cappella epiphany in his freshman year at San Francisco University High School, where he led the barbershop quartet in a production of “The Music Man. ” A few years later, Mr. Sharon enrolled at Tufts University just so he could join that school’s Beelzebubs, an a cappella group. The love wasn’t immediately returned: He got in only on his third audition. “They said I was overzealous,” Mr. Sharon recalled. “My   was perfect, so when I pointed out a small mistake I’d made, they thought I was pretentious. ” (Benji in the “Pitch Perfect” movies is partly based on Mr. Sharon.) College was also when Kurk Richard Toohey Jr. officially became Deke Sharon. “It wasn’t meant as a stage name,” he explained. “Everybody called me Deke, and my mom had remarried, so I had all these different names in my childhood. I just wanted an identity of my own. ” The same year he helped found the House Jacks, Mr. Sharon also created the Contemporary A Cappella Society as part of his effort to cement the   community and improve its outreach. But it’s    where his temperament  —   earnestly upbeat, but with a   humor and a subtly forceful undertone blocking any threat of saccharine  —   is most effective. “My knowledge of a cappella was limited, but Deke is very good at meeting people where they are and giving them what they need so they can get where he wants them,” recalled Birgitte   who played the leader of Das Sound Machine in “Pitch Perfect 2” and stars in the Broadway revival of “Les Liaisons Dangereuses. ” Mr. Sharon’s interpersonal and technical skills were critical for a show like “In Transit,” which presented several challenges for the cast and crew  —   starting with the fact that the actors double up as the orchestra and almost never stop singing. “Sometimes they go offstage, change their costume, walk around the back of the house and come back in from another side, singing all the while,” Mr. Sharon said. “And they can’t miss a beat, go out of time or rhythm. The technical difficulty is the highest not only that I’ve ever worked on, but that I’ve ever known to be done a cappella. ” To sync with each other, the actors wear   monitors so they can best hear all the vocal layers as well as the musical supervisor, Rick   who voices his cues from backstage. Getting used to the earbuds was a steep learning curve. Margo Seibert, one of the stars, said it was like trying to sing while putting your head under water in a bathtub  —   a “  moment” for her. “The first week, their faces looked like they’d just eaten a bad lemon,” Ms.   said of the cast, laughing. “But Deke was so confident and positive that everyone went, ‘O. K.!’ And that’s a gift to have in the room. ” A   “huge a cappella nerd,” Justin Guarini, one of Ms. Seibert’s   was in a vocal group in high school. Still, he appreciated Mr. Sharon’s input. “I’m learning from him, and it’s an awesome feeling,” he said. “He’s not a teacher so much as an educator. ” For the tireless Mr. Sharon, a Broadway show is just one more way to bring about a culture in which everybody sings and where diversity is not just lip service but a structural asset. “Most choral ensembles want a homogeneity of sound,” he said, “but I want a different configuration of sounds and notes and voices. The overall experience of seeing these very diverse people onstage together makes a statement that is so necessary in today’s society. ” Ms.   added: “He truly believes that groups of people singing together creates goodness in the world. And at this moment in time, we really need that kind of harmony. ”",0
21892, SPINELESS: Paul Ryan Actually RAN AWAY From Reporters After Trumpcare FAIL (VIDEO),"Everyone knows Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has absolutely no backbone, but what he did yesterday was an entirely new low for the Republican Party.Yesterday was a disaster for the GOP to begin with. Donald Trump pathetically failed to gain enough votes for the disastrous American Health Care Act, and the GOP suffered a major humiliation as the glorious plan they ve been promising to implement and do away with Obamacare with for the past seven years deteriorates before their eyes. After such a horrible, embarrassing day, it was clear that Ryan didn t have it in him to face the press and answer the many critical questions that Americans have about Trumpcare.Ryan emerged from the failed discussions over Trumpcare, visibly frustrated and not in the mood to make nice with reporters. He gave a short statement in which he was clearly angry and uncomfortable: For seven and a half years, we have been promising the American people that we will repeal and replace this broken law because it s collapsing and it s failing families, and tomorrow we re proceeding. He ended his address abruptly, literally running off and away from reporters demanding answers. You can watch this disgusting behavior below, courtesy of the Rachel Maddow Show: This is clearly a sign that the GOP knows how badly they ve just failed, and they re aware of how pathetic the party looks right now. This could not be a more painful time for the GOP   their disastrous reality television star of a candidate won the election and even though he s only been in the White House a little more than two months, he s f*cked things up more than anyone thought he would. With Trump s help, the Republican Party has done irreversible damage to its reputation   and they only have themselves to thank. Ryan s cowardly behavior only solidifies the fact that the GOP is crumbling before our very eyes.Featured image via screenshot",1
57950,EU refugee court ruling triggers new east-west feuding,"LUXEMBOURG/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU s highest court ruled on Wednesday that member states must take in a share of refugees who reach Europe, dismissing complaints by Slovakia and Hungary and reigniting an east-west row that has shaken the Union s cohesion. The Mediterranean migrant crisis which prompted mandatory quotas in 2015 for relocating asylum seekers from Greece and Italy has receded, easing immediate pressure to force compliance on nationalist leaders who are making electoral capital from lambasting the EU while benefiting from Brussels  subsidies. But defiant rejection from some ex-communist states that the EU accuses of slipping on democratic standards - Hungary called the judgment a political  rape  of EU law - indicated no let-up in tensions that are testing the Union s internal cooperation. In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is fighting for re-election against opponents who criticize her for taking in over a million migrants at the height of the drama, the interior minister threatened legal action against countries which fail to take in their allotted share of Syrian and other refugees. But Hungary, where outspoken Prime Minister Viktor Orban has built border fences and made keeping out migrants a key plank of his re-election campaign for next year, branded the European Court of Justice ruling  appalling and irresponsible .  This decision jeopardizes the security and future of all of Europe,  Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said.   Politics has raped European law and values.  Italy, now the main destination for migrants taking to the sea following measures to block the route from Turkey to Greece and from Greece northward, has been prominent in calling for the wealthier Western states to cut EU subsidies to poor neighbors which do not show  solidarity  in taking in migrants. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has echoed that threat, warning Orban  solidarity is not a one-way street . But the EU executive is also anxious to calm tensions ahead of negotiations on a new seven-year EU budget that will be all the harder because of a hole left by Britain s imminent departure. The Commission said on Wednesday it may seek fines at the ECJ within weeks for Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic if they do not start or resume taking people from the south. Poland and Hungary, which argue Muslim immigration is a threat to their national security and stability, have in two years taken in none of their respective quotas of about 6,200 and 1,300 people. However, the executive, which is separately considering trying to suspend eastern heavyweight Poland for undermining the independence of its judiciary, stressed it wanted solutions that would unite the 28-nation bloc. Slovakia s prime minister said he still rejected quotas but was willing to help in other ways. And as the Union digests a Brexit vote last year that was partly driven by concern over migration, many states that backed the quota system in 2015 and are increasingly exasperated by Polish and Hungarian hostility to Brussels are also reluctant to force through new policies that may bolster eurosceptics across Europe who say the EU is trampling on national sovereignty.  If we push it through above their heads, they will use it in their anti-EU propaganda at home,  one EU diplomat said, while noting that, with the migration crisis dropping out of the headlines, all sides might find a way to resolve the issue. The Commission is working on reforms to the so-called Dublin rules under which people arriving in the EU must stay to claim asylum in the first country they reach. A mechanism to help the likes of Greece and Italy in emergencies has proved elusive. However, governments may find it easier to negotiate now that the migration is not quite so prominent in local politics. The Luxembourg-based ECJ dismissed  in their entirety  the arguments advanced by Hungary and Slovakia with backing from Poland and endorsed the Commission s solution which eventually ordered states to take in nearly 100,000 Syrians and others.  The mechanism actually contributes to enabling Greece and Italy to deal with the impact of the 2015 migration crisis and is proportionate,  the court said in statement. Difficulties in identifying candidates for relocation - and a reluctance of refugees to settle other than in the wealthier west of Europe - saw fewer than 30,000 people relocated in two years, but the Commission noted an acceleration in the program this year and said it would continue to move people northward. Among the gravest problems the migration crisis caused was member states reimposing controls on internal EU frontiers. That had jeopardized one of the Union s most cherished achievements and for a time appeared to threaten to disrupt internal traffic. EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said special exemptions that have allowed the likes of Germany, Austria, Denmark and Sweden to control their borders with EU neighbors should now end when they expire in two months  time.

24593," Secret Meeting Reveals Trump Camp’s REAL Economic Plan, And It’s NOTHING Like What We’ve Heard","Trump has been telling the whole world about how he ll make our economy boom. He s going to cut taxes, but not cut Medicare or Social Security. He tells blue collar workers that he ll renegotiate all our trade agreements to bring their jobs back. He s going to balance the federal budget within seven years. He has something for everyone, but no plan to pay for any of it.Or does he?Trump s senior economic adviser, Stephen Moore, held a hush-hush meeting with the vice president of the Council for National Policy, Bill Walton. In that meeting, Moore revealed a lot of the ins and outs of the campaign s ideas for paying for his plan, and the whole thing smacks of far-right, free-market, trickle-down, anti-government conservatism unlike anything we ve seen before.Moore wants Trump to eliminate the Department of Education, Department of Commerce, and Department of Energy, just to start. That will cost, oh, about 150,000 jobs or so. Not to mention that, with the elimination of the Department of Commerce, we ll lose the U.S. Patent Office, the U.S. Census Bureau, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and more. Trump believes, however, that this is the source of a lot of crony capitalism and corporate welfare. So make it disappear!They also want to get rid of the Department of Education. That, however, will cost us a uniform accreditation process for colleges and universities, along with everything having to do with grants and student loans. No biggie, everyone can just get private student loans from their own banks, right? Right. Even if they re the poorest of the poor. They d have to, seeing as how it s not likely Congress will pass universal post-secondary education anytime soon.It s Moore that s pushing Trump to do something about the Department of Energy. including ending the energy subsidies. Eliminating the entire department will probably cost us every national laboratory we have that deals with energy research and development. This includes the famous Los Alamos National Laboratory, which was responsible for developing the atom bomb. They also work on nuclear research, cryogenics, and more (maybe they ll just hand these over to private companies with profit motives).He actually said, in that meeting: I mean, my God, why do we need an Energy Department? All the Energy Department has done in the last 25 years is make energy prices more expensive! Or it was due, at least in part, to giving utilities to private enterprises with a profit motive, but hey, he can think what he wants. They can, of course, move these agencies and offices to other departments, and maybe consolidate some, but the savings from doing this won t be near what they likely think.Moore believes in sending things like job training, health care and other medical services, back to the states. The federal government would give the states block grants to administer this stuff. Perhaps Trump would give them yuuuuuuuuuuuuuge block grants to administer all of the above things that will disappear with department elimination, too.And then they ll slowly go away as budgets get cut. States are notorious for finding ways around the strings attached to block grants, which allows them to divert that money to other things.But these kinds of proposals aren t exactly new for Republicans. What Moore also wants Trump to do is lift all (read: all) restrictions and regulations on mining, drilling and fracking. And here we have it: The answer to which energy subsidies would get cut. The ones going to renewables, because of course.Lifting the regulations on fossil fuel production would, in Moore s view, create 6 to 8 million new jobs. Those jobs would increase tax revenue. That, plus ending the subsidies to renewables so that fossil fuels no longer have competition, would bring a windfall of cash.Then Trump can pay for the tax cuts he plans to give his rich buddies.That is, of course, assuming that fossil fuel prices stay where they are, or rise. The energy companies have to see a profit in this plan, or they won t play ball. We can t stop the rest of the world from developing renewables and leaving us in the dust, and we can t stop OPEC from continuing to produce as much as they want to compete with us.Working as closely with a master businessman as Moore is, he should know that falling demand means falling prices. The energy companies have already put some brakes on fracking here because of the glut of oil worldwide. It s not as profitable to frack right now as they want.Plus, no regulation at all? Yeah. That ll work. You watch. It ll be great. We ll have the best market. Companies will become safer and more environmentally conscious because of competition.Or so the free-market capitalists  wet dreams say.Moore really hopes that Trump will climb on board with all of this. After all, Moore just wants to help his candidate  make America great again,  and clearly, this will do it. It s foolproof!Featured image by Alex Wong/Getty Images",1
13050,Russia warships: Kuznetsov battle group ‘refuels off North Africa’,"BBC News A group of warships including Russia’s only aircraft carrier, the Admiral Kuznetsov, is reportedly refuelling at sea off North Africa en route to Syria. 
Plans for some of the ships to dock at a Spanish port were cancelled after Nato allies voiced concern. 
Nato is concerned planes from the carrier could be used to attack civilians in the Syrian city of Aleppo. 
President Vladimir Putin also hinted that an aerial bombardment of rebel-held east Aleppo could resume. 
Russia and its ally, the Syrian government, had said earlier that they would continue a moratorium on the bombing. 
At an international conference in the Russian city of Sochi on Thursday, Mr Putin said other parties to the conflict had not been keeping their promises. 
“Where is the disengagement of terrorists from the healthy part of the opposition?” Mr Putin asked. 
“So far we have been restrained, and we have not been rude to our partners, but everything has its limits. We could respond.” 
The Admiral Kuznetsov can carry dozens of fighter bombers and helicopters. It has been sailing for the past week from Russia to the Mediterranean. 
The BBC’s Jonathan Marcus reports from Brussels that the battle group is currently at anchor off the North African coast and taking on fuel. 
The group has two “oilers” (tankers) with it and it is not clear which of the vessels is actually refuelling, he adds. 
The Russian embassy in Madrid formally withdrew a request to Spain for refuelling after being approached by the Spanish foreign ministry. 
“Given the information which appeared on the possibility that these ships would participate in supporting military action in the Syrian city of Aleppo, the ministry of foreign affairs requested clarification from the embassy of the Russian Federation in Madrid,” the Spanish foreign ministry had said on Wednesday in a statement to the BBC. 
It added that permission had been granted in September for three Russian ships to dock in the port of Ceuta between 28 October and 2 November. It said such stops for Russian naval vessels had taken place for years in Spanish ports. 
Nato had said the final decision on resupply rested with Spain. 
“We are concerned and I have expressed that very clearly about the potential use of this battle group to increase Russia’s ability and to be a platform for air strikes against Syria,” Nato’s Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told journalists on Tuesday. Image copyright EPA Image caption The warships came down the Channel 
The naval group also includes a nuclear-powered battle cruiser, two anti-submarine warships and four support vessels, probably escorted by submarines. 
The battle group is expected to join about 10 other Russian vessels already off the Syrian coast. 
Some 2,700 people have been killed or injured since the Russian-backed Syrian offensive started last month, according to activists. 
Western leaders have said Russian and Syrian air strikes on Aleppo could amount to war crimes, an accusation rejected by Russia. 
About 250,000 civilians who live in Aleppo have been trapped by the fighting. Moscow announced last week a “humanitarian pause” in attacks as part of a plan to allow civilians and fighters to leave the area.",1
47990,Illinois governor eyes blocking Chicago school debt,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner said on Monday the state has the power to block any debt offerings by financially distressed school districts, including the cash-strapped Chicago Public Schools (CPS), which has been dependent on borrowing to fund operations.  The Republican governor last week launched a financial probe of the nation’s third-largest public school system through the Illinois State Board of Education. Rauner, who has called for a state takeover of the school district, said the board has the legal authority to block borrowings by districts found to be in financial duress.   “The state board has never chosen to do that for the city of Chicago. I hope that never becomes necessary. But we’ve got to be ready to take action,” Rauner told reporters. Rauner’s office pointed to a provision of the school code that it says applies to CPS. The provision prohibits the sale of bonds, notes or other debt by a district certified to be in financial difficulty until a financial plan is approved by the state board of education. CPS Chief Executive Forrest Claypool contended that the authority Rauner seeks to exercise does not apply to CPS, according to a school district spokeswoman. CPS is struggling with a $1.1 billion structural budget deficit, caused largely by escalating annual pension payments that will reach $676 million this fiscal year. The district’s efforts to gain an additional $480 million in state dollars to pay its pension bill have become entangled in an ongoing impasse between Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature. To keep operating in anticipation of $1 billion in property tax revenue next month, CPS turned to short-term borrowing and a $725 million bond sale earlier this month for cash flow. The district said it plans to seek additional short-term borrowing authority from its governing board in the future. Rauner said accusations by Chicago officials that he attempted to derail the Feb. 3 bond sale by pushing for a state takeover or possible bankruptcy for CPS were “completely false.” Skittish investors demanded hefty yields for the “junk”-rated bonds, which will cost the district nearly $1.9 billion to pay off by 2044.

13300,Friday Mailbag: When the President Attacks - The New York Times,"Over the past week there has been an escalating feud between the executive and judicial branches of the U. S. government. When a Federal District Court judge in Seattle, James Robart, blocked President Trump’s travel ban, Trump went on the attack, calling Robart a “  judge,” the ruling “ridiculous” and the courts “so political. ” Even “a bad high school student would understand” why his ban should stay in place, the president said. Trump’s own nominee to the Supreme Court called the president’s comments “demoralizing” and “disheartening. ” When one story on the deepening drama ran on the home page, a reader noticed that its home page headline referred to the executive branch merely as the “U. S. ” The story’s digital headline read: “Justice Department Urges Appeals Court to Reinstate Trump’s Travel Ban,” while the home page version was: “U. S. Urges Court to Revive Ban Hearing Set for Tuesday. ” The public editor’s take: That’s a good catch. I’m sympathetic to headline writers, who are constricted by space limitations as they try to convey ideas clearly and accurately. And in most usage, referring to the executive branch U. S. is appropriate. In this case, it’s misleading. Trump also continued his onslaught of the news media, claiming that it plays down coverage of terrorist attacks. The White House even released a list of 78 attacks it claimed the media undercovered. Several readers wrote in to ask The Times to push back, which the paper did, publishing a compilation of the attacks that the paper has covered thoroughly. It did so, however, to the chagrin of some other readers. The public editor’s take: I am in full agreement. Playing defense is not the position The Times wants to find itself in  —   not over frivolous charges, anyway. If Trump or his administration challenges the thrust of a story based on anonymous sources, The Times has an obligation to explain itself to readers. Otherwise, taking such bait is just a distraction. Trump also targeted The Times specifically this week through his favorite medium, Twitter. This prompted several readers to ask whether The Times could take legal recourse against the president. The public editor’s take: I went out looking for answers from a pair of knowledgeable legal hands, and here’s what I found: The president has broad immunity from civil claims arising from the performance of his official duties. There is a convoluted legal argument over how broad. The matter of whether a judge would classify “tweeting” as an official duty remains untested. I’m guessing no lawsuit from The Times is coming anytime soon. Nor should there be one, in my view. That would be a waste of resources and would cast the news organization in opposition to the president. Its job is to cover him, fairly and aggressively. A line in a column about Kirsten Gillibrand and the   left raised the eyebrows of a couple readers for its perceived sexism. The public editor’s take: Hmmm. I’m alert to coverage with sexist overtones and I’ll be writing more in the future  —   so keep those letters coming. In this case, my antenna didn’t go off. I took Ginia Bellafante’s pudding reference as the wry commentary of a columnist  —   a category of journalist that enjoys more leeway. Several readers this week also took issue with The Times’s explanation for the rating of the film “Sophie and the Rising Sun”: “Rated R for interracial sexy time. ” We took this question to Stephanie Goodman, the film editor, for an explanation. The public editor’s take: A little levity in movie ratings? Seems like a little   fun to me. Finally, a lifelong reader of The Times passed away recently, and his granddaughter wrote in to tell us how much he appreciated the paper till his final day. Perhaps some reading indoors, in memory of Shanahan’s grandfather, would help those of us in the Northeast brave the snow. Updated 11:00 a. m. February 10, to include Trump’s latest attack on The Times, earlier Friday morning.",0
10607,Хорошее худым не назовут,"Наука и техника 
Исследователи из Ирландии встали на тропу войны с женским недугом современности – безумным похудением. Эксперты заявили, что им удалось изобрести чудодейственный препарат, регулирующий в организме человека уровень загадочного гормона грелина – «повелителя голода и аппетита». Предполагается, что инновационный медикамент станет спасением для барышень, страдающих анорексией. 
У пациенток после ирландского чудо-средства появится нормальный аппетит. Любая 40-килограммовая дюймовочка, которая долгие годы работала над собой, чтобы добиться торчащих рёбер и впалых щёк, вдруг начнёт грезить о своём злейшем враге – о еде! Тростиночке вместо традиционного салатного листика вдруг захочется чего-нибудь существенного – жирного борща со шкварками, например. Да-да, сотни калорий в одной несчастной плошке. Но кто же думает о калорийности еды после долгого мучительного голодания? 
Не верится, что ирландским учёным удастся в наше время много заработать на таблетке для «потолстения». А как же золотые слова супермодели Кейт Мосс: «Нет ничего вкуснее, чем чувствовать себя худой»? Да некоторые худышки считают эту цитату своим жизненным кредо. Малоежки ни за что не поменяют завидную аристократическую костистость на что-то банальное, вроде свиной котлеты. Как же трогательные статусы в социальных сетях: «Голод – твой друг, он не предаст тебя, как еда», «Мир анорексии – мир гламура, выбившийся из потока обычной жизни», У меня есть преимущество – я худая»? А если с обладательницей неотразимых ножек-спичек на фоне приёма ирландских пилюль произойдёт страшная катастрофа – плюс 20 сантиметров в талии? А если жертва диет, истосковавшаяся по вкусностям, настолько пристрастится к еде, что потеряет голову – и превратится в заложницу холодильника? Коварный гормон грелин уж очень любит пошалить. 
Желание соответствовать идеалу глянцевой красоты доводит девушек не только до анорексии, но и до противоположного расстройства пищевого поведения – булимии. Пациенты с этой странной хворью, которая дословно переводится как «волчий голод», склонны к неконтролируемому обжорству, «пищевым срывам» и вечно плохому настроению. Благо, про них тоже позаботились учёные. В прошлом году всезнающие исследователи Англии, решив, что клин клином вышибают, изобрели волшебный … суп от булимии. В состав блюда входит особый вид крахмала, способствующий быстрому наступлению чувства насыщения. 
Британские эксперты в вопросах диетологии настолько увлеклись производством диетического питания, что помимо супа изобрели ещё несколько продуктов для похудения: хлеб, йогурт и коктейль. Осталось только представить миру жиросжигающую картошку-фри и антицеллюлитное пирожное – и исполнится мечта всех худеющих дам. В сочетании с низкокалорийной колой такие продукты будущего, пожалуй, пойдут на ура! 
Питаться нормально – умеренно и без всякого фанатизма – непростое дело. На эту тему есть хороший «стишок»: 
когда идёшь чеканным шагом из всех углов так вкусно пахнет нельзёй 
В наш век изобрели множество средств для коррекции фигуры – от чая до вибропояса. Новости с пометкой «шок», вещающие миру об очередном средстве против лишних килограммов, появляются в сети с завидным постоянством. Вес и похудение, формы и рельефы, салаты и тортики – мы чересчур много думаем о пустых вещах. Отсутствие каши и винегрета в голове куда ценнее содержимого наших тарелок. Наполненный едой холодильник – это огромный соблазн и большая проблема лишь для тех, кто не желает наполнить радостью жизнь.",1

5395,"Veteran’s Memorial Desecrated By Protesters, Can You Help Us Find Them? | Conservative Daily Post","
Posted by Matthew Bernstein | Nov 9, 2016 | American Strength People Thought It Would Be A Good Idea To Deface A Memorial Dedicated To Military Veterans 
Despite all the talk of the election that has been discussed there is another significant event and pseudo-holiday coming up in two days. That would be Veteran’s Day. It’s a holiday that, as stated, is designed to make sure that we can remember our veterans from all military encounters. 
It’s something that should be taken very seriously, considering the fact that these veterans gave the ultimate price to make sure that YOU have the freedoms that you do now. And some people in the United States do, considering that there is memorials set up to honor these veterans. 
Except not everyone thinks that these memorials should be taken seriously. In fact, there are some people out there that don’t respect the memorials and everything that they stand for. They think it’s a good idea to DISRESPECT the memorials that are out there. 
The most recent example comes from someone who is against the Dakota Access Pipeline. They were so against it that they thought the best course of action would be to vandalize a memorial that was set specifically for World War II veterans in Washington. That came from the National Park Service on Tuesday. People Thought It Would Be A Good Idea To Vandalize A World War II Memorial 
A spokesman by the name of Mike Litterst said that someone spray-painted the North Dakota section of the memorial. A photo that was provided by the park service showed the phrase “#NoDAPL” was written in paint. Yes they thought the best way to protest this would be to vandalize a memorial designed to honor military service members. 
That is honestly the most disgusting thing that could have EVER happened. There shouldn’t EVER be a reason that someone should vandalize a MILITARY memorial just to get their point across. These people put their lives ON THE LINE to make sure that you have the right to protest like you are doing! 
The person that vandalized this memorial was protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe has been fighting along with other tribes and environmental groups in an effort to stop the completion of the nearly $4 billion pipeline. They claimed that it was going to threaten the water supply for millions of people. 
The supporters of the pipeline have said that it is a safer way to move oil rather than trucks and trains. Considering that oil is very flammable and accidents can happen, I would rather see something be moved safely. But no matter what side you are on, vandalizing a memorial designed for military veterans is something that SHOULDN’T happen! 
As of right now, the United States Park Police are investigating the vandalism. But there is good news about this whole thing. The vandal had used paint to make his mark. And a paint stripper has been used to remove much of the damage that had been done. 
The pipeline protests have been going on for a long time. But President Obama has said that the federal government was looking for ways to “reroute” parts of the pipeline. It sounds like another attempt to appease people on the president’s behalf. 
But the bottom line is that these people thought it was a good idea to make their message heard by spray painting a VETERANS MEMORIAL! That is the ultimate sign of disrespect! And it makes it worse when you factor in that Veteran’s Day is literally two days away. It’s like they don’t care about the fact that these veterans made the ultimate sacrifice so they could pull those actions. These Men Risk Their Lives So That Families Across The USA Can Enjoy Freedom 
Every American should honor the fact that these veterans have given everything that they possibly could to make sure that the freedoms of the United States stay that way. And every memorial that is destroyed and vandalized is just another reminder that not everyone believes that military veterans should be thanked. 
Those people are some of the worst Americans on the planet. If you want to protest something, then fine, but there is NO EXCUSE for anyone to vandalize a memorial designed to honor those that served. And the simple fact that someone thought it was a good idea is sickening. 
There are several ways to make your point but this is among one of the absolute worst out there. And what is even worse is that there are people that are going to think that it was a good idea. 
Sadly this isn’t the first time that this has happened. There were people that thought it was a good idea to vandalize a September 11, 2001 memorial . And the worst part of that was they actually did it. In a college town in California people thought it was a good idea to destroy something that means a lot to some people here in the country. 
That wasn’t the only time that this has happened. Just a couple weeks ago there was another report that someone thought it would be a good idea to destroy a veterans memorial . Yes there are people here in the United States that want to make sure that military people don’t get the respect that they deserve. It’s like these people have just lost all respect for those that have given everything and more for the safety of the country. 
Share this article to make sure that we can find the person, or people, that is responsible for destroying a monument that is dedicated to our military veterans. What makes it worse is that it is so close to Veteran’s Day. The pure timing of this entire action is something that should make every red-blooded patriot in the country angry. 
We need your help to make sure that the people that are responsible for this action are caught and brought to justice. This type of activity is simply unacceptable. But with your help we can find the protestors that are responsible and make sure they pay for their crimes. ",1
8585,GOD Has Chosen Trump,"GOD Has Chosen Trump 

Trump cannot win. The American people are lost. We are about to be totally destroyed. Based on what I have learned, these are logical conclusions. This is what my logical mind would have me believe and my logical mind is wrong! Against All Odds 
To date, Donald Trump has defied all odds. He is the only candidate in the moderate era, with a chance at becoming President, who is still his own person. He owns himself and from a Christian perspective, that is problematic. However, this is clearly God’s plan. He is the only man who broke the choke hold on the GOP by the criminal Bush family. We are a nation whose ruler, at the moment, is planning to attack the American people with foreign troops after collapsing the economy. There are plans to attack the American military, who would dare stand with the people, in defense of our culture, Christian traditions and personal liberties. 
In his march to the Presidency, Trump has overcome the following: Vicious and unrelenting attacks from the media. Vilification from both the left and the right. He has escaped assassination. He won a Presidential nomination when the entire leadership of his party, said he would never become President because “they” choose, not the people. Trump is not owned by any special interest and the special interests, despite their hit ads and secret meetings to plan on how to remove Trump for their personal reasons, cannot figure out how to marginalize Trump. 
It doesn’t matter who comes against Trump, he only grows stronger with each successive victory. Just ask Glenn Beck how well he is doing after throwing all his resources behind Cruz. And ask lyin’ Ted and Heidi how their marriage is doing after going through this ideal. Hillary is headed to prison. “And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.” Revelation 19:15 God Will Choose Whom He Wishes 
I know that Donald Trump is not running a Christian political campaign. But in case you have not noticed, God can, and has, used anybody to lead of his own choosing. And that this critical time in history, why would God choose a Christian leader? After all, America has become the most unchristian nation. We have murdered 60 million unborn citizens without a trial. We glorify every perversion, wickedness and intrusive behaviors. We live in a nation that kills innocents with drones. Our every move is spied upon. I have covered how Obama, a man of very low moral character, has placed “enemies of the state” (i.e. the Muslim Brotherhood terrorist organization) into key positions in our government (i.e. DHS). 
Our church leaders have been recruited to abandon their flock and to lead them astray. Your pastor puts IRS tax laws ahead of the word of God. When was the last time your Pastor spoke to the congregation about the evils of abortion and how it needed to be stopped? Pedophilia is the last prohibition that remains intact in our Godless nation and that prohibition is about to be removed through the efforts of George Soros and Kevin Jennings (Hillary Clinton’s education lackey who happens to be transgender). America has not only become a Godless nation, it has become a despicable collection of perverts and murderers. The Common Sense Show exists thanks to perverts and criminals like Hillary Clinton. 
Donald Trump is not a Christian and he does not have to be because he does not lead a Christian nation. Donald Trump is a modern day Jehoshaphat (see 2 Chronicles 20). His people were faced by three overwhelming armies. Jehoshaphat and his people had no chance to survive in the same manner as Donald Trump and the American people. Yet, God worked an amazing miracle and Jehoshaphat’s enemies attacked each and killed each other as Jehoshaphat’s men were signing praises to the Lord. And what followed was truly amazing: And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the Lord fought against the enemies of Israel. So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about. Serving God’s Will 
Against all odds, we will soon have a leader who will soon serve God’s will, whether or not he realizes that this is chosen mission. 
“And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.” Revelation 19:15 (KJV) Conclusion 
I know our plight seems hopeless as we are outnumbered, outspent and out-gunned. However, my Lord does not know defeat. I just need to be silent and trust in the Lord, he will use who and what he needs to advance his will. So what do we do in this monumental time that we live in? Listen to the Lo rd and just keeping working the cause as God would wish it to be. This movement will sweep the planet. We already see a Trump wannabe in the Philippines. We seeing the stage set for the final days. Trump is a central figure in the fulfillment of prophecy.",1
3842,Street Artist Mocks Kim Jong-Un with ’Trump North Korean BBQ’ Posters (Photos),"Los   street artist provocateur Sabo is back again, this time to skewer North Korean leader Kim   with a series of mock posters promoting a fictional line of “Trump’s North Korean BBQ. ”[The mock posters  —   which have popped up around the Koreatown neighborhood of Los Angeles  —   feature the North Korean dictator’s head superimposed onto a roasted pig’s body, and with an apple placed in his mouth. Alongside the image is an insert of a smiling Trump.  The taglines for the mock  include “The finest in ” “The world’s greatest really,” and “Cooked up by five star chef James Mattis. ”  A telephone number displayed on one of the billboards apparently connects to an art gallery in Beverly Hills. The posters’ appearance in Los Angeles comes as hostilities between the United States and North Korea have hit renewed heights in recent weeks. NBC News reported that the National Security Council presented military options to President Trump  —   including the possible assassination  of the North Korean dictator  —   to deal with the country’s increasingly defiant nuclear program ahead of Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week.  Sabo has previously featured images of Trump in his street art. In November, just after Trump’s victory in the presidential election, the street artist peppered Los   bus benches with fake  for Sotheby’s real estate sales, in a campaign lampooning numerous celebrities’ pledges to move out of the country if Trump were elected. Most recently, the artist trolled the Academy Awards by erecting posters outside the Dolby Theater in Hollywood that blasted the film industry’s “unwatchable movies. ” Sabo has also skewered Hillary Clinton, at one time placing an image of the former Democratic presidential candidate inside a washing machine as part of a “money laundering” series, alongside an image of actor Leonardo DiCaprio.

11795,"Maya DiRado, Exiting the Sport, Catches Katinka Hosszu and Grabs Gold - The New York Times","RIO DE JANEIRO  —   Maya DiRado saved her best race for last, winning the   backstroke in her final race before retiring to start a job with a management consulting firm in Atlanta. DiRado trailed Hungary’s Katinka Hosszu for the first 150 meters. Swimming next to Hosszu in the third lane, DiRado caught Hosszu with less than 25 meters left and   her by   of a second. DiRado, 23, was timed in 2 minutes 5. 99 seconds. Hilary Caldwell of Canada placed third in 2:07. 54. The duel between DiRado and Hosszu pitted two of the most successful swimmers of this Olympics. DiRado finished with two golds, one silver and a bronze. Hosszu, 27, who failed to win a medal of any color in her first three Games, collected three golds to go with her silver. The final was missing the   holder and defending champion, Missy Franklin, and the reigning world champion, Emily Seebohm, as neither advanced past the semifinals. DiRado was in Franklin’s semifinal heat on Thursday, and when she saw the times on the scoreboard, she swam over to a tearful Franklin and consoled her. DiRado said she had told Franklin that she was an amazing teammate and that the United States team loved her no less because she failed to make the final. The gesture meant the world to Franklin, who choked up as she said she would be rooting hard for her in the final. “For her to support me in the way she has is so incredible,” Franklin said. Hosszu said she was pleased with her medal haul. “Honestly, I’m superexcited,” she said. “This Olympics was a good one for me. ” It was dreamlike for DiRado, who finished second behind Hosszu in the 400 I. M. and placed third in the 200 I. M. also won by Hosszu. Her other gold came in the 4x200 freestyle relay, where DiRado took the place of a struggling Franklin. DiRado considered the backstroke event her “fun third event. ” She looked shocked when she glanced at her time at the end of the final and saw a “1” next to her name. “The emotions definitely came out as soon as I finished,” DiRado said. And she is done. To end her career with an Olympic gold medal, DiRado said, “is the perfect way to go out. ”",0

55676,"From batons to barbecues, Catalan vote exposes police divisions","SANT PERE DE TORELLO, Spain (Reuters) - As Spanish police wielded batons and fired rubber bullets at crowds attempting to vote in Catalonia s banned independence referendum on Sunday, the region s own police force gave many voters a much gentler reception. In Catalonia s pro-independence heartland, among the farming towns of Osona county north of Barcelona, the Catalan force made little attempt to remove people from polling stations despite being tasked with the same court order to shut them down. Local courts received several complaints on Sunday against the Catalan police accusing them of inactivity and failing to close polling stations, despite the court order, the region s High Court said in a statement. In Sant Pere and Osona s capital of Vic, crowds waited in orderly queues and cast their ballots in school halls, though the mood was jittery as photos of bloodied voters circulated via social media from the cities of Barcelona and Girona. More than 840 people were injured during Sunday s police crackdown, Catalan officials said. Spain s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, however, praised the police for carrying out their duties and upholding the law. In Sant Pere, children ran along the street playing tag, young people passed around barbecued kebabs and flagons of red wine, and pensioners at a retirement home nearby sat by windows and waved Catalan flags.   If we don t win today, we will never be able to do it. This is the opportunity,  Ramon Jordana, a 92-year-old former taxi driver said as he dropped his vote into a ballot box that organizers had smuggled into the town in the dead of night.  At the polling station in Sant Pere, a town of some 2,500 people close to the Pyrenees which symbolically declared independence from Spain in 2012, voters arrived before sunrise and Jordana cast the first vote at 9 a.m. Officers from Catalonia s regional police, the Mossos d Esquadra, had tried to enter Sant Pere and Vic s polling stations before voting began but crowds clustered around the entrances to stop them. They withdrew to applause and cheers.  We won t use force to enter, but we ll stay outside all day in case at some point we can,  one of the officers in Sant Pere told Reuters afterwards. He asked not to be identified. The two officers in Sant Pere chatted casually with locals outside the polling station, and one of them posed with a child for a photo. After a second attempt to enter the voting center, the crowd resisted and they retreated around a street corner. In Osona s overwhelmingly separatist-controlled municipalities, opinion polls show support for independence tops 80 percent on average, around double the overall support among Catalonia s 7.5 million population. The referendum has been declared illegal by Rajoy s central government in Madrid, which says the constitution states the country is indivisible, and it has dispatched police across Catalonia to seize ballot boxes and prevent people voting. However, national police and the Mossos have taken very different approaches, despite Spain s state prosecutor telling Mossos recently that they had been put under a single chain of command reporting directly to the interior ministry in Madrid. The Mossos are held in great affection by Catalans, especially after they hunted down Islamists accused of staging coordinated attacks in Barcelona in August which killed 16 people. In contrast, the Civil Guard national police were branded  Rajoy s thugs  on Twitter on Sunday. National police unions said officers had carried out an  impeccable intervention  to preserve the constitution and called the Mossos  inaction  scandalous .  The national police are disappointed and indignant ... The Mossos  presence has been insufficient, deliberately weak and embarrassingly neutral,  the unions said in a statement. In Sant Pere, before voting got underway, the town s mayor, Jordi Fabrega, asked a crowd of about 200 people to guard the booth s entrance all day and to resist peacefully any attempt by police to enter.  The moment we leave it unguarded, they will come,  Fabrega said. The first count of Sant Pere s vote showed 80 percent turnout with 97 percent of voters supporting independence. High turnout will be key to legitimizing a  yes  vote, which the Catalan government says would lead to a declaration of independence from the regional parliament within 48 hours.  Locals blocked streets with vans and construction trucks as word spread that national police, who have been drafted into Catalonia in their thousands, were en route to raid the polling station.  If the police really want to get the ballot boxes, they will get them,  said one Sant Pere voter, 66-year-old Carles, who declined to give his surname as he was worried the Spanish government would come after him. In the end, no national police turned up. Organizers said it had been no easy task to get to this point. Joan Vaque Casas, Sant Pere s head coordinator, said he had received a text message at about 2 a.m. to meet at a secret location to pick up the ballot box and voting papers. ",0
14935,"Review: They’ve, Sob, Remade ‘Beaches’ - The New York Times","“Beaches,” directed by Garry Marshall and released three decades ago, was a curio even in its own time: a pastiche of 1950s   that was set, strangely and uncomfortably, in the 1970s and ’80s. Portraying the lifelong friendship of two women, one of whom dies too young  —   you could say that’s a spoiler, but it’s really the only thing the movie’s about  —   it was a shamelessly retrograde and   soap opera with a veneer of fake feminism. (Careers and single motherhood were fine as long as they involved constant suffering.) Depending on your susceptibilities, it could inspire cultish devotion or impel you to yell at the screen. It was not, by any measure, a movie that needed to be remade. But here we are, 29 years later, with a new television version of “Beaches” on Lifetime on Saturday night. Idina Menzel has taken the Bette Midler role of C. C. Bloom, the brassy Jewish   (originally from the Bronx, now from Venice Beach) and Nia Long succeeds Barbara Hershey as Hillary Whitney, who originally was a   lawyer. The Lifetime “Beaches” is a reduction of the original  —   smaller emotions, smaller performances, fewer songs, shorter running time (about 87 minutes versus 123)  —   and while that could have been an improvement, it’s not. The things that made the original worth sitting through, whether you were   or   are mostly gone. Stuffing the story into 70 percent of the time makes C. C. and Hillary’s cycle of fights and reconciliations feel more arbitrary than ever, especially in the absence of Ms. Midler, whose vivid portrayal of C. C. provided motivations that weren’t in the script. The new things in the Lifetime film, written by Bart Baker and Nicole Beckwith (based on a novel by Iris Rainer Dart) and directed by Allison Anders, add nothing to the story. Casting Ms. Long, who’s black, would seem to add diversity, but so much of the (admittedly clichéd)   and California   flavors have been stripped away from C. C. and Hillary that the characters feel more indistinguishable than they did before. Some of the film’s precious time is devoted to a new character, Hillary’s lawyer father, so that when he dies, she can make a statement about black men and the justice system. Meanwhile, you watch it noting the things that are missing, even those that made you cringe. No more Ms. Midler singing “Under the Boardwalk. ” No more Mayim Bialik as the frighteningly confident    C. C. belting out “The Glory of Love. ” No more John Heard supplying a touch of grace as the theater director whom both C. C. and Hillary love. No more “That’s my robe. ” There is one improvement: Ms. Menzel sings “Wind Beneath My Wings” a   sooner than Ms. Midler did. Just in case that’s what you’re waiting around for.",0
52758,Israel finds bodies of five Gaza militants killed in tunnel demolition,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Sunday it had recovered the bodies of five Palestinians who were killed when it blew up a tunnel last week that was dug by militants under the Gaza Strip border, and hopes they can be used to effect the return of Israelis held in Gaza.   The bodies of seven other militants were recovered on the Gaza side of the frontier last Monday when Israel destroyed the cross-border tunnel, raising the death toll to 12. A military statement said that since the tunnel was blown up, forces had worked in Israeli territory to complete its  uncovering and destruction and that  during the ongoing work in the area, the bodies of five terrorists were uncovered.  On Friday, the Islamic Jihad militant group said that five of its militants were missing.  Israel said this year it would withhold the bodies of Palestinian militants killed in attacks against its citizens in order to pressure the larger Islamist Hamas faction to return the remains of soldiers and hand back missing Israeli civilians. Hamas says it is holding two Israeli soldiers whom the army declared dead after they were lost in action in the 2014 Gaza war. The group also says it is holding two Israeli civilians who strayed into the territory. Simha Goldin, the father of one of the two Israeli soldiers, on Sunday urged the Israeli government to live up to its promise and said:  Pressure will make Hamas understand that holding Israeli soldiers in not an asset but a burden.  Both Islamic Jihad and Hamas have refused to discuss any deal with Israel. Dawoud Shehab, an Islamic Jihad spokesman in Gaza said on Sunday:  We are committed to regaining the bodies of our comrades and we will find a way to compel the enemy to do this.  During the 2014 Gaza war, Hamas fighters used dozens of tunnels to blindside Israel s superior forces and threaten civilian communities near the frontier, a counterpoint to the Iron Dome anti-missile system that largely protected the country s heartland from militant rocket barrages. Neither Israel nor militants in Gaza have appeared eager to seek escalation. Israel has been constructing a sensor-equipped underground wall along the 60-km (36-mile) Gaza border, aiming to complete the $1.1 billion project by mid-2019. Israel and the United States have called for Hamas to be disarmed as part of the pact between Hamas and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, so Israeli peace efforts with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which collapsed in 2014, can be renewed. Hamas has rejected the demand. Hamas said Israel had made a  futile attempt to sabotage efforts to repair Palestinian unity,  a reference to the reconciliation agreement it reached with Abbas last month in which his forces have take over administration of the enclave.

49941,Honduras election tribunal says to hold partial re-count in presidential vote,"TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduras  election tribunal will re-count 4,753 ballot boxes that have cast a shadow on the results of the country s presidential election, the tribunal chief said on Thursday, bowing to a demand by the Organization of American States (OAS). Nearly two weeks since Honduras  Nov. 26 presidential election, the result remains unknown, with allegations of electoral fraud sparking protests and a chorus of international concern over events in the poor Central American nation.  Official results showed Honduras  conservative President Juan Orlando Hernandez with a narrow 1.6 percentage point lead over center-left opposition leader Salvador Nasralla. However, no victor has yet been declared by the election tribunal. The tribunal declared Nasralla the leader in an announcement on the morning after the vote, with just over half of the ballot boxes counted. However, it gave no further updates for about 36 hours. Once results then started flowing again, Nasralla s lead quickly started narrowing.  On Thursday, after meeting with the United States  top diplomat in Honduras and the OAS country representative, tribunal chief David Matamoros said there would be a re-count of ballot boxes that arrived after the 36-hour pause, and which the opposition has claimed are tainted.  This is a process we want to undertake in front of the eyes of the world, and we want to invite civil society,  Matamoros said at a press conference in the capital, Tegucigalpa.  The OAS, which on Wednesday said it may call for new Honduran elections if  irregularities  undermine the credibility of results, had previously called for a recount of those 4,753 ballot boxes. It remains to be seen if the opposition will accept the tribunal s offer. Nasralla on Wednesday evening called for an international arbiter to oversee a recount of the entire 18,000-odd ballot boxes, saying he no longer recognized the Honduran tribunal because of its role in the process. Separately, Honduras  security ministry said on Thursday it was removing the curfew from three more departments, meaning only six of the country s 18 departments are still under curfew. ",0
1910,‘Brexit’ Bats Aside Younger Generation’s European Identity - The New York Times,"PARIS  —   You could say theirs is the Generation of Three E’s. There is Erasmus, the European Union program that organizes and subsidizes student exchanges among universities across its 28 countries and elsewhere. There is easyJet, the budget airline that lets them hop between European cities as simply and cheaply as it can be to trek across town. And there is the euro, the currency used in most of the member countries. Young adults are now grappling with what Britain’s vote to exit the European Union means for their profoundly European way of life. For them, it is perfectly normal to grow up in one country, study in another, work in a third, share a flat with people who have different passports and partner up without regard to nationality. “It means that we are not going to be sisters and brothers of a big project,” said Antoine Guéry, 24, a Frenchman whose résumé and network of friends provide a crash course in European geography. “At best, we are going to be allies”  —   friends, but no longer family. “It feels less like home. ” Mr. Guéry works at a   firm in Paris but had been looking for job opportunities in London  —   an exercise he shelved immediately after the “Brexit” vote on June 23. His degree is from Sciences Po University in Paris, but he also studied at Stockholm University and Germany’s University of Potsdam. It was in Stockholm that two German women, Carolina Leersch, now 26, and Kim Seele, 28, joined his inner circle. In Berlin, Mr. Guéry lived with Ms. Seele’s aunt, had an Irish boyfriend and befriended Lauren Muscroft, who is British, and Marion Desbles, who is from Rennes, France. This group and others like it are, to be sure, a subset within a subset, part of a fourth E  —   the elite  —   who studied at the Continent’s top institutions and took advantage of the   doors open to them. Splitting Britain from the European Union may put a damper on future changes important to this globalized generation, like the move toward a single European digital market for movie and music streaming, and the end, by next year, of cellphone roaming charges when crossing European Union borders. Days before the British referendum, Mr. Guéry, Ms. Muscroft and Ms. Desbles jokingly wondered, while waiting in the passport lines at the airport in Barcelona, Spain, whether Britons like Ms. Muscroft would soon be kicked out of the European Union lane. Now, the friends are wondering whether their children will be able to benefit from Erasmus as they did. If their European health insurance cards will still cover them in Britain. Whether France might soon follow with a Frexit vote, the Netherlands with a Nexit, and who knows what else? “My initial reaction when it happened was feeling like part of my identity had been stripped away,” said Ms. Muscroft, 24, who works in London for an online   site. “One thing I’ve always really felt a strong connection to, with Europe, is a unified sense of fate  —   the fact that we are all in this together, and that we benefit each other through this union. ” Perhaps the most profound force in creating this European identity was Erasmus, now called Erasmus+ which was created in 1987 and had supported 3. 3 million students studying or training abroad by the end of   academic year, according to a European Union report. (Yet, in the last five years, fewer than 5 percent of all university graduates in the participating countries were Erasmus students.) Magali Ballatore, a sociologist at the University of   in France who wrote a book on the Erasmus program, said it would be hard to tease out whether Erasmus alumni were internationally minded because of the experience, or whether that prospect had attracted them to the program in the first place. But younger Europeans are more likely to report an attachment to the European Union than those 55 and over, according to the most recent Eurobarometer survey. In Britain before the balloting, surveys showed that 57 percent of voters ages 18 to 34 wanted it to remain in the bloc. (An identical percentage over age 55 supported the Leave campaign.) In the vote’s aftermath, many young voices have expressed fear and despair. “I’ve never been so angry,” Mr. Guéry said. “I was texting friends, people who did Erasmus, people who lived in Britain or Germany. We are disgusted that this might be the trigger for the destruction of the only good thing that these governments have done in 50 years: peace. ” It is still unclear what kind of relationship Britain will negotiate with the European Union, but trade is unlikely to screech to a halt and   travelers are not likely to face stringent visa requirements. As for the union’s Erasmus program  —   in which Britain ranked fifth two years ago for students sent abroad and fourth for foreign students taken in  —   nonmembers like Iceland, Norway and Turkey are already allowed to participate. Until Britain officially leaves the union, the program will continue there, too. Britain had always stood apart in any case, having never adopted the euro or joined Europe’s   Schengen zone. Ms. Leersch, the German whom Mr. Guéry met at Stockholm University, counted among the benefits of European Union membership the 500 euros per month (about $550) that Erasmus provided to cover living expenses in Sweden her   internship at the European Parliament in 2011 and the European Capitals of Culture program, which has given a boost to artists and tourism in more than 40 cities. For Mr. Guéry, the list of advantages included environmental regulations and his European health insurance card, which gave him access to health care when he had mononucleosis in Berlin. Ms. Seele, who is studying for the bar exam in Berlin, said that for those and other reasons, she “really feels like a European. ” Many of her friends, as well as her brothers and sisters, have studied or worked abroad in Europe. “The fact that you don’t have to exchange money anymore, that you don’t have to go through border control and show your passport, it is part of the feeling that you are not leaving from one country to the other,” she said. “That you are still more or less in one community. ” For this generation, at least, that sense of community is easily fostered. Texting and social media like Facebook and Skype help people stay in touch, no matter how far away when they want to meet, discount airlines like easyJet and Ryanair make the borders further disappear. Mr. Guéry and his friends meet every three to six months  —   sometimes back in Berlin, but also in Brussels, Budapest and other cities. That also means more exposure to very different people and places. “I never had an opinion on Norway, for example, before I moved abroad,” Ms. Muscroft said. “And suddenly one of my closest friends is Norwegian. ” Even this staunchly   group knows the union is far from perfect. (“Stop voting on stupid things like olive oil labeling, and answer the need for security and immigration policy,” Mr. Guéry said.) The friends hope that Britain’s departure will push the institution to reform itself, but there are also concerns that it will fuel political extremes at home. “What I’m most worried about is how Marine Le Pen and other leaders at the National Front are using these kinds of debates for their own political purposes,” said Ms. Desbles, a    teacher, referring to the   party and its leader, who favor a similar breakaway for France. Mr. Guéry has been thinking about his grandparents and   who bore the brunt of both world wars. “So much of my family suffered from the stupidity of nationalism,” he said. “I can’t imagine my continent going back 50 years. ” When Mr. Guéry was 13, he refused to take German classes at school  —   “a Nazi language,” he thought at the time. His mother persuaded him to do otherwise, but the three E’s helped, too. “I lived in the heart of what destroyed my country,” he said of Germany. “But I learned the story of the people now I speak the language. I didn’t do that by myself. It’s because of Europe. ”",0
4463,"‘Ghostbusters’ Is No. 2, Behind ‘Secret Life of Pets,’ but Sony’s Giddy - The New York Times","LOS ANGELES  —   “We got one!” Those words, shouted by a   Annie Potts in the 1984 version of “Ghostbusters,” summed up the feeling on the Sony Pictures lot on Sunday, as the   studio released a remake of that comedy to solid results. The new “Ghostbusters,” directed by Paul Feig and featuring women in the main roles, took in about $46 million over the weekend at theaters in the United States and Canada. It was only good enough for second place, behind Illumination Entertainment’s “The Secret Life of Pets” (Universal) which collected an estimated $50. 6 million in its second weekend, for a new domestic total of $203. 2 million, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. But ticket sales for “Ghostbusters” were strong enough to merit revelry nonetheless. “We’re totally ecstatic,” Josh Greenstein, Sony’s president of marketing and distribution, said by phone. Resuscitating any film franchise that has been absent from theaters for 27 years (ever since “Ghostbusters II” arrived in 1989) is extremely difficult. In this case, Sony had the additional challenge of facing down internet trolls unhappy about the casting of Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones and Kristen Wiig. In Hollywood, trouble like “Ghostbusters” faced before its release can either prompt damaging studio infighting, as executives squabble over what to do, or it can galvanize a management team in new ways. Sony, currently in last place among the six major studios as measured by annual domestic ticket sales, has undergone an extreme makeover in the last 17 months, with Thomas E. Rothman taking over as movie chief in February 2015. “The team really pulled together,” Mr. Greenstein said. Even so, Sony and Village Roadshow spent $144 million to make “Ghostbusters”  —   ads cost at least $100 million more  —   leaving the film a long way from profitability. Sony is counting on foreign ticket sales, although China, the world’s No. 2 box office market, is unlikely to clear the   film for release. Mr. Greenstein said he expected the generously reviewed reboot to perform well in the weeks ahead. “Paul’s movies have big, huge, high multiples, and there are no big comedies on the horizon,” he said. Amid more straightforward summer remakes and sequels, “the movie is both new and nostalgic, which makes it stand out,” he added. For the weekend, “The Legend of Tarzan” (Warner Bros.) was third, taking in about $11. 1 million, for a   total of $103. 1 million. Also of note: Woody Allen’s “Café Society” (Lionsgate) got off to a strong start in five theaters, collecting $355, 000.",0

As it emerged that many men will spend their declining years alone, aged males confirmed that beneath their crusty, irascible exterior there was only more irascibility. 79-year-old Roy Hobbs said: “Some people seem to think that when I tell them to fuck off I actually mean ‘I crave companionship, come and have some cake’. “What I actually mean is ‘fuck off’. “I spent most of my middle years hiding alone in a shed.

54796,Indian court acquits dentist couple of killing daughter,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Thursday overturned the conviction of a dentist couple for the murder of their teenage daughter and the family servant for lack of material evidence, their lawyer said. Aarushi Talwar was found with her throat slit at the family home in the Delhi suburb of Noida in 2008. A day later, the body of the servant, Hemraj, was found on the roof of the house. A trial court convicted the girl s parents, Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, after police alleged Rajesh had murdered his daughter and the servant in a rage when he found them in a compromising situation. The couple, both dentists, were jailed for life. But a high court overruled the decision saying it was not satisfied with the evidence and ordered the couple be freed, their lawyer Tanveer Ahmed Mir said.  The court found no forensic or material evidence to prove that the Talwars had killed their daughter,  Mir told reporters outside a packed courtroom in the northern city of Allahabad. Both parents had denied the murder and insisted they were victims of botched investigations and unfair media coverage, damaging their defense. Aarushi s case was labeled as a kind of crime more often associated with rural, conservative parts of India where  honor killings  are not uncommon. Every twist in the investigation was extensively reported by the Indian press, turning the Talwars into household names.  Finally my family can lead a dignified life. The court has upheld the facts and truth,  said Rajesh Talwar s sister, Vandana, after the decision. In 2015, a journalist who covered the murder wrote a book arguing that the couple were innocent. The double murder case and faulty probe were used as a theme for a Bollywood movie the same year.   ",0
359,"EU Increases ‘Brexit Bill’ Demand to €100 Billion, Up From €60 Billion","The European Union (EU) has dramatically increased the size of the “divorce” bill it is demanding the UK pays before leaving the bloc, to 100 billion euros. [The new figure, equivalent £84. 5 billion, reflects stricter demands made by Germany and France, in particular in relation to   farm payments and EU administration fees, according to an analysis by the Financial Times.  European Commission president   Juncker and chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier have previously said the UK would be expected to pay around €60 billion (£50. 75 billion). The British Government’s lawyers, however, and a House of Lords committee have said the UK has no legal responsibility to pay the £50 billion bill and the prime minister is opposed to handing over a large amount. David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, reiterated these claims Wednesday morning, as well as implying the escalating demands were merely part of the EU’s negotiating tactics. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme Wednesday morning, Mr. Davis said recent comments from his European partners should be “taken with a pinch of salt”. “You have seen in the mixture of gossip and spin there are attempts to shape opinions, try to put across robust points of view,” he said. “This is merely preliminary to negotiations. The simple truth is that this is early manoeuvring. We have to deal with it with equanimity. ” Speaking to ITV Tuesday night, he added: “We’ll not be paying 100 billion. What we’ve got to do is discuss in detail what the rights and obligations are. ” The rising bill reflects a hardening of the EU’s Brexit negotiating stance. According to the Financial Times, the French and Polish governments have pushed for the inclusion of   annual farm payments, whilst the Germans are against granting Britain a share of EU assets. The UK would also be held to guarantees and loans to countries such as Ukraine and Portugal, with Britain being reimbursed as the loans are repaid. Over the period of a decade or more, therefore, the repayments would reduce the net size of the “Brexit bill” to between €55 billion and €75 billion. Mr. Barnier has previously said the UK will not be able to begin discussions on a future trade deal with the bloc, or guarantee the rights of UK citizens in the EU, until the bill is settled.",0

In a speech in the capital Ankara, Yildirim said a “new page” would be opened in U.S.-Turkey relations if Washington extradited the U.S.-based cleric Turkey blames for orchestrating the July 15 failed coup. “An area of opportunity has been created for the new president to advance relations with policies taking into account Turkey’s fight against terror,” Yildirim said.

34802,TWO SENATORS SAY NO TO MOVING MUSLIM TERRORISTS FROM GUANTANAMO BAY TO THEIR STATES,"Yeah because everyone wants these guys living in their hometown Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Pat Roberts of Kansas are up in arms about reports that the Pentagon is scouting sites in their home states to house terrorist prisoners currently detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. We have received reports of President Obama s attempt to shut down Guantanamo Bay, which once again reflects another egregious overstep by this administration,  Roberts said in a statement on Friday, referring to the law preventing transferring any of the inmates to a U.S. prison. Congress has consistently stopped Obama by law from moving a single detainee to the U.S.,  Roberts said in reaction to reports that Kansas s Fort Leavenworth is being considered as the terrorist suspects  new home. I shut down this administration s nominee for secretary of the Army in 2009 to prevent moving any detainees to Kansas and will do it again if necessary,  he said.  Not on my watch will any terrorist be placed in Kansas. Graham was equally emphatic upon learning that Defense Secretary Ash Carter is also considering Charleston for the new high-risk installation. If the detainees need to be moved, they must be moved to a maximum security location in a remote area far from heavily populated areas with vital infrastructure,  Graham told the Washington Post earlier this week.  Charleston does not meet that criteria. The Pentagon on Thursday confirmed to lawmakers that it is studying both Forth Leavenworth and the Consolidated Naval Brig in Charleston as potential sites. These visits will also help refine our baseline standard for what a facility should look like to inform potential selection of other locations to evaluate in the future,  the Defense Department notification read.Transferring the remaining 116 detainees to the U.S. is being considered as an option for closing Guantanamo Bay. Moving the prisoners to other countries requires congressional notification and unanimous sign off by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice and State, along with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Earlier this week the Pentagon said it would present Congress with a plan to shutter Guantanamo Bay when they return to Washington after Labor Day.

39444,Trump's Virginia comments last straw for disenchanted CEOs,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several U.S. chief executives had been considering resigning from Donald Trump’s business advisory councils for months after the president said he would pull out of the Paris climate accord and ban transgender people from the military, sources told Reuters on Wednesday, long before Trump’s comments on racial violence this week pushed them over the edge. Trump disbanded two high-profile advisory groups on Wednesday, after the head of his Strategic and Policy Forum advised the White House the group was breaking up, and a trickle of departures from his American Manufacturing Council threatened to become a mass exodus. “He was at 95 percent already,” a source close to Larry Fink, head of investment firm BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), said of Fink’s leaning toward resigning from the Strategic and Policy Forum.  “I think that (Trump’s latest comments) just made it 120 percent.”  A number of CEOs started to consider more seriously whether to disband after Trump’s initial remarks blaming violence at Saturday’s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on “many sides,” which was taken to include not only white nationalists but also anti-racism activists who opposed them. Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) CEO Kenneth Frazier, an African-American, was the first to leave the manufacturing council on Monday over Trump’s weekend reaction.   Trump then attacked Frazier on Twitter, prompting other CEOs to consider quitting also. Frazier’s resignation was followed by the CEOs of Under Armour Inc (UAA.N) and Intel Corp (INTC.O) later on Monday. Trump’s fiery comments on Tuesday, doubling down on his initial response to the Virginia rally, unnerved CEOs already doubting the utility and public relations value of remaining on Trump’s councils, sources close to several of the CEOs told Reuters.  Soon after Trump’s comments on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon, who serves on the Strategic and Policy Forum, started pushing for the forum to take some kind of action, a person close to him said. Dimon had previously expressed exasperation with politics in Washington, saying in July that it is “almost an embarrassment being an American citizen traveling around the world.” Sensing a breakdown in the group, Stephen Schwarzman, CEO of money manager Blackstone Group (BX.N) and chairman of the Strategic and Policy Forum, convened a call on Wednesday for its members. After some debate, “the momentum was such that there wasn’t much room for dissent,” said one source familiar with the discussion.  The decision to disband was agreed and Schwarzman called the White House to inform the president, the source said. Shortly after, Trump tweeted that he was disbanding the two groups.  The leader of the manufacturing council, Dow Chemical Co DOW.N CEO Andrew Liveris, had planned a call with remaining members to try to salvage the group on Wednesday, according to an email seen by Reuters. The call never took place, superseded by Trump’s dissolution of the group.     Sources familiar with the discussions of the boards of Merck and Intel said that they backed their CEOs’ decisions to leave because they did not believe stepping down from Trump’s councils would have a negative impact on their businesses.  “I don’t think these are personal decisions,” said Blain Rethmeier, a Republican strategist who worked on the Trump transition and consults with companies in California. “I think these are made through the eyes of what’s in the best interest of the company, and the brand risks of what it means to be involved with the council became too much.” ",0
50491,Factbox: Countdown to Brexit breakthrough?,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The next two weeks will determine whether Britain avoids further costly delays in giving business assurances of a smooth exit from the European Union and free trade in the future. Following is a timeline of critical meetings and explanation of the key decisions that need to be taken. British Prime Minister Theresa May wants the EU to open the second phase of Brexit negotiations, concerning relations after Britain s withdrawal on March 30, 2019. The EU will only do that if there is  sufficient progress  in agreeing  divorce  terms, notably on three key issues: a financial settlement, guaranteed rights for EU citizens in Britain and a  soft border  with Ireland. A deal on money is effectively done, EU officials say, and they are close on citizens  rights, leaving Ireland the biggest headache outstanding. [nL8N1O06MU] [nL8N1O12A0] As part of the intricate  choreography  for a political deal, the EU set May an  absolute deadline  of Monday, Dec. 4, to provide new offers in time for the other EU leaders to approve a move to Phase 2 at a summit of the EU-27 on Friday, Dec. 15.  May is pushing for a simultaneous, reciprocal guarantee from the EU of a soft transition and future trade deal, which she may use to show Britons what her compromises have secured. The EU wants to have firm British offers which the 27 can discuss before leaders commit. The result is some complex dance steps: Mon, Dec. 4 - May lunches in Brussels with EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker and Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier. The latter says he plans a  joint report  on progress with the UK. Wed, Dec. 6 - Juncker chairs weekly European Commission meeting in the morning. After hearing Barnier, the Commission could say there is sufficient progress to move to Phase 2. Wed, Dec. 6 - At 3 p.m. (1400 GMT), EU-27 envoys meet to prepare decisions to be taken at EU-27 summit on Dec. 15   most significantly on opening talks on what happens after Brexit. Thur, Dec. 14 - May attends routine EU summit in Brussels, starting in the afternoon. Defense, foreign affairs on agenda. Fri, Dec. 15 - After May has left, EU-27 leaders hold summit. They could take one comprehensive decision on Phase 2 or break it down into separate ones on the transition and future ties. January - Outline of EU transition offer may be ready, under which Britain retains all its rights except voting in the bloc, and meets all its obligations until the end of 2020. [nL8N1MZ59A] February - After agreeing among the 27 their negotiating terms, EU may be ready to open talks with London on a free trade pact that Brussels likens to one it has with Canada. [nL8N1NL26Q] The EU estimated at some 60 billion euros ($71 billion) what Britain should pay to cover outstanding obligations on leaving. EU officials say there is now agreement after Britain offered to pay an agreed share of most of the items Brussels wanted   especially for committed spending that will go on after 2020. Both sides say there is no precise figure as much depends on future developments. British newspaper reports that it would cost up to 55 billion euros sparked only muted criticism from May s hardline pro-Brexit allies who once rejected big payments. Barnier is still seeking a commitment that the rights of 3 million EU citizens who stay on in Britain after Brexit will be guaranteed by the European Court of Justice, not just by British judges. May has said the ECJ should play no more role in Britain. But the issue could be vital to ensure ratification of the withdrawal treaty by the European Parliament. A compromise might focus on making clear that the ECJ has a role only for the existing EU residents, whose numbers will shrink over time. Member states, some of which have taken a tougher line than the Brussels negotiators, are also insisting Britain make concessions on family reunion rules and social benefits. The EU wants more detail on a British pledge to avoid a  hard border  at the new land frontier on the island of Ireland that might disrupt peace in Northern Ireland. London says the detail depends on the future trade agreement. EU officials say a hard border can be avoided only if rules remain identical on either side. Northern Ireland could stay in a customs union with the EU. But Britain, and May s crucial Northern Irish parliamentary allies, insist there should be no new barriers between Northern Ireland and the British mainland. The EU says that means the whole of the United Kingdom would then have to follow EU rules, something Brexit campaigners do not want. A British newspaper reported London was considering offering Northern Ireland more autonomy to set different rules. But at present, party feuding means the province has no government. Dublin says it may not be possible to reach a deal on sufficient progress by Monday but in the days after that. Ireland, with the blessing of the EU-27, says it will veto any move to Phase 2 if Britain s border offer is unsatisfactory. ",0

22818, Donald Trump’s New Campaign Slogan Is LITERALLY From Horror Film ‘The Purge’,"Seriously, he really picked this as his 2020 slogan. We re all gonna die.Donald Trump hasn t even served a day as president, and won t officially do so until Monday since he has decided that the first two days after his inauguration will be vacation days. However, he has already picked a slogan on which to run during the 2020 campaign.During an interview with the Washington Post, Trump got all sorts of giddy about a slogan he thought of to use four years from now.According to the Washington Post,Halfway through his interview with The Washington Post, Trump shared a bit of news: He already has decided on his slogan for a reelection bid in 2020. Are you ready?  he said.    Keep America Great,  exclamation point. Get me my lawyer!  the president-elect shouted.Two minutes later, one arrived. Will you trademark and register, if you would, if you like it   I think I like it, right? Do this:  Keep America Great,  with an exclamation point. With and without an exclamation.  Keep America Great,    Trump said. Got it,  the lawyer replied.There s just one legal problem and one terrifying problem with this new slogan.First of all, the slogan has already been used by a movie as a tagline, so trademarking and registering it could be rather difficult and result in legal issues.Second, the movie Trump is apparently trying to steal the slogan from is  The Purge: Election Year,  which is an installment of a horror film series, set in America, in a dystopian future where every citizen in this country is allowed to commit any crime they want, no matter how horrible, for an entire day without consequences.Don t believe it? Here s the trailer via YouTube.Here s another one in which the lead character, a U.S. Senator played by Elizabeth Mitchell, explains that the annual  purge  targets the poor and the innocent.Trump picked a seriously f*cked up slogan this time, and considering that he will be in control of the White House while Republicans control Congress, everyone should be scared to death.Featured Image via screen capture from embedded video ",1
37366,Second U.S. judge blocks Trump administration birth control rules,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A second U.S. judge on Thursday blocked President Donald Trump’s administration from enforcing new rules that undermine an Obamacare requirement for employers to provide insurance that covers women’s birth control. U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. in Oakland, California, said the federal government likely did not follow proper administrative procedures in promulgating the new rules, and put them on hold while a lawsuit challenging their legality proceeds. The decision followed a similar ruling from a federal judge in Philadelphia last Friday that blocked the administration from enforcing rules it announced in October allowing businesses or nonprofits to obtain exemptions on moral or religious grounds. Gilliam ruled on a lawsuit pursued by Democratic attorneys general in California, Delaware, Maryland, New York and Virginia. He said that a preliminary injunction was necessary given the “dire public health and fiscal consequences” that could result as a result of the administration adopting the rules without the input of interested parties. “If the Court ultimately finds in favor of Plaintiffs on the merits, any harm caused in the interim by rescinded contraceptive coverage would not be susceptible to remedy,” he wrote. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement that, given last week’s decision in Pennsylvania, “today’s ruling amounts to a one-two punch against the Trump administration’s unlawful overreach.” The U.S. Justice Department defended the rules in court.  Lauren Ehrsam, a department spokeswoman, said the agency disagreed with the ruling and was evaluating its next steps. “This administration is committed to defending the religious liberty of all Americans and we look forward to doing so in court,” Ehrsam said in a statement. The lawsuit is among several that Democratic state attorneys general filed after the Republican Trump administration revealed the new rules on Oct. 6, which targeted the contraceptive mandate implemented as part of 2010’s Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The rules will let businesses or nonprofits lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide contraceptive coverage in health insurance with no co-payment. Conservative Christian activists and congressional Republicans praised the move, while reproductive rights advocates and Democrats criticized it. ",0
20962, Arizona Republican Says College Kids Make Elections Unfair – Unveils Despicable Plan To Stop Them,"It s an old story: A demographic won t vote Republican, so Republicans find ways to prevent said demographic from voting instead of figuring out what they can do to get that group to vote for them. An Arizona Republican is once again engaging in this nonsense by claiming that college students unfairly influence elections because they register to vote where they go to school, and not where their permanent addresses are.Bob Thorpe s claim is that the votes of college students  dilute the votes of full-time residents  in local elections. Thorpe represents Flagstaff, which is home to Northern Arizona University. Republicans had a difficult time holding their seats in that particular district. What Thorpe wants to do is prohibit students from using their dorms or other college addresses from registering to vote.Thorpe tried to spin his voter suppression tactic into something positive with this absolutely transparent lie: [This proposal will ]address several problems with voting in Arizona s college communities while ensuring that voting rights are preserved for all Arizona voters. Preserving voter rights for all Arizonans. Ha!There s a problem beyond the obvious one of voter suppression: Thorpe makes no mention of other part-time residents who flee colder states to reside in Arizona for six months out of the year. One bloc of part-time residents is okay, another is not. While snowbirds might maintain two permanent addresses one in one state and one in Arizona Thorpe doesn t seem to have a problem with them  diluting votes  of permanent residents. Snowbirds,  as they re called, tend to vote Republican, and they tend to vote against things like budget overrides for the educational system, since they don t want to pay for an education system that doesn t include their children.College students, on the other hand, tend to vote Democratic and education budget questions (along with everything else educational) affect them directly. Both Tucson and Tempe home to the University of Arizona and Arizona State University respectively are heavily Democratic. Flagstaff leans red but could go either way.So Thorpe, like other Republicans who would rather cheat that change their policy positions, decided that the problem is the college students not voting where they ought to be. He wants to make it so they have to register with their permanent addresses, and then get their ballots mailed to their college addresses.That kind of thing could discourage them from voting, in addition to preventing them from voting for people and things that directly affect them while they re in school. It s time for Republicans to figure out why they aren t reaching certain demographics and stop trying to force those demographics out of the electorate.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",1

1462,"Another Appeals Court Rules Warrants Required for ""Stingray"" Cellphone Surveillance","By Derrick Broze
An appeals court in Washington has ruled that law enforcement must acquire a search warrant before employing cell phone surveillance tools often known as “Stingrays.”
On September 21, an appeals court in Washington issued a damning ruling regarding law enforcement use of cell phone surveillance tools without the use of a warrant. The appeals court became the fourth court to rule against the unrestricted use of the controversial cell site simulators, sometimes known as “Stingrays.” The issue could eventually make its way to the Supreme Court. Stingray is the brand name of a popular cell-site simulator manufactured by the Harris Corporation.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation describes Stingrays as “a brand name of an IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) Catcher targeted and sold to law enforcement. A Stingray works by masquerading as a cell phone tower – to which your mobile phone sends signals to every 7 to 15 seconds whether you are on a call or not – and tricks your phone into connecting to it.”
This allows the officer who is in possession of the Stingray to know who, when, and to where you are calling, the precise location of every device within the range, and with the latest models, capture the content of your conversations. As the use of Stingrays has grown quickly in the last five years, the public has largely remained in the dark as investigative journalists work to expose the technology.
The case involves Prince Jones, a man sentenced to 66 years in prison after he convicted of sexually assaulting two women. During Jones’ trial it was revealed that D.C. police used a Stingray to locate Jones. The police used the device without first obtaining a warrant. Mr. Jones’ attorney unsuccessfully attempted to have the evidence suppressed at his original trial due to this warrantless tracking. However, the appeals court ruling means the evidence cannot be used and the conviction is overturned.
“The simulator’s operation involved exploitation of a security flaw in a device that most people now feel obligated to carry with them at all times,” wrote Judge Corinne Beckwith in the majority opinion for the court.
Allowing the government to deploy such a powerful tool without judicial oversight would surely ‘shrink the realm of guaranteed privacy’ far below that which ‘existed when the Fourth Amendment was adopted.’
In addition, Judge Beckwith wrote that the use of Stingrays “place an individual in the difficult position either of accepting the risk that at any moment his or her cellphone could be converted into tracking device or of forgoing ‘necessary use of’ the cell phone”.
Prosecutors attempted to convince the judges that it is common knowledge that cellphone can be tracked and thus no expectation of privacy exists. Beckwith disagreed, stating that “a person does not lose a reasonable expectation of privacy merely because he or she is made aware of the government’s capacity to invade his or her privacy.”
The 2 to 1 ruling from the D.C. Court of Appeals comes after similar rulings in the Maryland Court of Special Appeals and federal district courts in New York City and San Francisco.
Nathan F. Wessler of the American Civil Liberties Union, told the Washington Post that the ruling “joins the growing chorus of courts holding that the Fourth Amendment protects against warrantless use of invasive, covert technology to track people’s phones. … We applaud today’s opinion for erecting sensible and strong protections against the government violating people’s privacy in the digital age.”
The growing use of Stingrays and the consistent secrecy of federal and local law enforcement agencies has lead to at least one other instance of a federal judge throwing out evidence which was gained using a stingray. In July 2016, a federal judge in Maryland rejected evidence because police did not obtain a warrant before using the device. Still, there is no consistent policy on how police should handle new technology like the Stingray.
In 2015, the Department of Justice issued a policy guidance ordering its agencies to obtain a search warrant before using the cell site simulators. This guidance does not apply to local and state police. With four federal and state courts now ruling that law enforcement must obtain a warrant before use of Stingrays, it is likely one of these rulings will be challenged in the Supreme Court. Until then, local and state law enforcement are operating in as much secrecy as possible.
It is only through the work of investigative journalists and whistleblowers that the public understands the depth of these devices. The situation has even garnered the attention of the U.S. House and Oversight Committee. In late 2016, the committee issued a report titled, “Law Enforcement Use of Cell-Site Simulation Technologies: Privacy Concerns and Recommendations.” The report notes that the U.S. Department of Justice has 310 cell site simulators spread across several agencies, including the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service. The DOJ spent more than $71 million cell site simulator technology and upgrades between 2010 and 2014. According to the report The Department of Homeland Security has 124 cell-site simulators.
The committee also called on state and local officials to adopt policies similar to those recently enacted by the Department of Justice. In addition, the committee recommend that law enforcement be more forthcoming with judges when they request approval for the use of the devices. As of September 2017, none of these recommendations have been implemented.

41597,Western push at U.N. to boost backing for Syria gas attack inquiry,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council could vote as early as Wednesday on a push by the United States, Britain and France to bolster support for international inquiries into a deadly toxic gas attack in Syria, diplomats said, a move Russia had deemed unacceptable and unwarranted. The three countries have proposed a revised draft resolution, diplomats said, similar to a text they circulated to the 15-member council last week that condemns the April 4 attack and pushes Syria’s government to cooperate with investigators. Western powers blame the sarin gas attack, which killed scores of civilians - many of them children, on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces.  Syria’s government has denied responsibility for the attack, which prompted a U.S. strike on a Syrian air base. The Security Council vote would come at the end of a visit to Moscow by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. A senior Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the most likely scenario appeared to be a veto of the U.N. resolution by Syrian ally Russia. Russia said last week the draft resolution was unacceptable and unwarranted.  The senior diplomat said that last week the Chinese had been prepared to abstain in a vote. Russia is one of five council veto powers, along with China, the United States, Britain and France. “We cannot give up and we must try in good faith, the best we can, to have a text of the Security Council condemning the attack, asking for a thorough investigation,” French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre told reporters on Tuesday. An Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) fact-finding mission is already investigating the attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in a rebel-held area of northern Syria. If they determine chemical weapons were used, then a joint U.N./OPCW investigation will look at the incident to determine who is to blame. This team has already found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and Islamic State militants used mustard gas. In February, Syrian ally Russia, backed by China, cast its seventh veto to protect Assad’s government from council action, blocking a bid by Western powers to impose sanctions over accusations of chemical weapons attacks. China has vetoed six resolutions on Syria. ",0
23780, BREAKING: Dir. Comey Just CRUSHED The GOP’s Fantasies Of Endless Clinton Investigations (TWEETS),"House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz has been fantasizing about investigating a potential President Hillary Clinton into oblivion based on her use of a private email server. After all, Chaffetz has promised, quote,  years  of Clinton investigations should she be elected. This all comes after an unprecedented   not to mention completely inappropriate   letter that FBI Director James Comey sent to House Republicans saying that he was re-investigating new emails. Well, now, Comey has, once again, cleared Hillary of what was to become yet another anti-Clinton GOP witch hunt, and House Republicans are sure to be furious. Here is the tweet of the letter:New Comey letter: FBI has not changed its conclusion regarding Clinton use of personal email server pic.twitter.com/IdKT1gweMf  Jim Acosta (@Acosta) November 6, 2016Nonetheless, Chaffetz himself had to admit that Hillary is in the clear with this one. He tweeted:FBI Dir just informed us ""Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Sec Clinton""  Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) November 6, 2016Of course, most sane people know that the idea that Hillary is some kind of criminal is nothing more than decades of right-wing witch hunting, and her campaign is right to say that they have always been confident that she did nothing wrong. Therefore, top adviser Brian Fallon tweeted the following regarding this news:We were always confident nothing would cause the July decision to be revisited. Now Director Comey has confirmed ithttps://t.co/BMQQx9eRzw  Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) November 6, 2016The thing is this, though: Comey and his rogue FBI agents directly impacted the election with baseless and wild accusations. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is supposed to be non-partisan, and has been anything but. Hell, there were inside agents who even called the New York FBI, quote,  Trumpland. The bottom line is this: The whole situation never should have happened. Rogue agents never should have been leaking information regarding an ongoing investigation, and Comey himself should have never gone to Congress with that letter eleven days shy of this all-important and highly contentious election.When Hillary gets elected, she should clean house, and restore confidence in one of America s most important institutions.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",1
40170,Trump says discussed forming cyber security unit with Putin,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Twitter on Sunday that he discussed forming a cyber security unit to guard against election hacking with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tweeting after his first meeting with Putin on Friday, Trump said now was the time to work constructively with Moscow, pointing to a ceasefire deal in southwest Syria that came into effect on Sunday. “Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded and safe,” he said following their talks at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. Trump said he had raised allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election with Putin. “I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I’ve already given my opinion.....” He added: “We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!” Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida immediately criticized the move on Twitter, saying Putin was not a trusted partner. Partnering with Putin on a “Cyber Security Unit” is akin to partnering with (Syrian President Bashar al) Assad on a “Chemical Weapons Unit,” he wrote.  Investigations by a special counsel, Robert Mueller, and several U.S. congressional committees are looking into whether Russia interfered in the election and colluded with Trump’s campaign. Those probes are focused almost exclusively on Moscow’s actions, lawmakers and intelligence officials say, and no evidence has surfaced publicly implicating other countries. Moscow has denied any interference, and Trump says his campaign did not collude with Russia. (This version of the story corrects the day of meeting in second paragraph to Friday) ",0
7136,Baba Vanga Was Right About Obama's Presidency And The 9/11 Attacks Sees Dire Future For Trump And The US,"The Blind Prophetess claims Barrack Obama will be the last president of the United States.

Baba Vagan is a cult figure in some circles in the Balkan states because of her uncanny knack for making astonishingly accurate predictions about the future.


Baba Vagan, who is sometimes referred to as the blind prophetess, is credited with predicting the events of September 11th, 2001 in the 1980s. It has been said that she had a vision of ‘American brethren’ being attacked by two steel birds which some believe could have symbolised the two hijacked jet planes which smashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Centre complex.

Perhaps even more impressively, she also made a prediction that the 44th President of the United States would be an African-American. However, unfortunately for the controversial president-elect Donald Trump, Vagan has said that Barrack Obama would be the last president that America would ever have and that Trump will never actually come to power. Extrapolating from this, supporters of Vagan have suggested that something catastrophic will happen to American civilisation in the space of the next two months and that the ramifications will be so deep that it would irrevocably abolish the office of the presidency. Others have suggested that it means that Trump will eschew the title and role of ‘president’ and instead install himself as a permanent dictator of the United States . 

It has been estimated that 85% of Baba Vagan’s prophecies have come to pass. However, sceptics have suggested that her prophecies are so vague that she is credited with being accurate more often than is reasonable. Her supporters have also been criticised for making fraudulent claims about her powers of psychic deduction.

However, for those who are inclined to find out more about the mysterious blind prophetess it may be of interest to know about some of her other predictions for the future. Vagan believes that human beings will have established cities under the oceans in 2130, that there will be a war on Mars in the year 3000 and by 3797 the Earth will be destroyed, but humanity will survive after fleeing to another universe.

3551,A Texas Woman ‘Voted Like a U.S. Citizen.’ Only She Wasn’t. - The New York Times,"When Rosa Maria Ortega was a teenager, her mother was deported to her native Mexico after being arrested twice. As she grew up, Ms. Ortega decided to take a different route. Lacking a high school diploma, she signed up for the Job Corps at age 18 and snagged a position at a state employment office. In 2012, she registered to vote, and not only cast ballots in the next two elections but served as a poll worker. Divorced, she raised four children, now teenagers, sometimes working three jobs. “When my mom was here, she did everything illegal,” Ms. Ortega, 37, said in an interview. “I wasn’t going to let that happen to me. ” She may not have a choice. Ms. Ortega, of Grand Prairie, Tex. a suburb between Dallas and Fort Worth, is a permanent resident with a green card, but she is not an American citizen. In a case that made national headlines last month, she was found guilty, fined $5, 000 and sentenced to eight years in prison because the ballots she cast in 2012 and 2014 were illegal. While   holders have many of the rights of citizens, they cannot vote. If the verdict is upheld, she will serve her sentence and, in all likelihood, be deported to Mexico. For   holders, a criminal conviction is effectively a ticket for deportation. Her punishment may be unprecedented for an offense that often draws a minimal sentence or probation. Ms. Ortega, who has a   education and a sometimes shaky grasp on the complexities of her life, has steadfastly insisted that she did not know she was violating the law  —   that she is being imprisoned and probably deported for the crime of being confused. “I thought I was doing something right,” Ms. Ortega said. “It wasn’t to hurt somebody, or the state, or the government. I even worked for the government. “I voted like a U. S. citizen,” she said. “The only thing is, I didn’t know I couldn’t vote. ” The case resonates in a polarized political environment where some are convinced that immigrants threaten to upend the nation’s shared values more than they continue its long history of accepting and assimilating outsiders. Ms. Ortega’s lawyers say they believe the severity of the sentence stems from the furor over immigration and false claims about voter fraud raised by Donald J. Trump’s nationalistic presidential campaign. One of Ms. Ortega’s lawyers, Domingo Garcia, said the case also raised questions about equality in the justice system. He cited a case three years ago in Fort Worth, in which a    boy from a wealthy white family was sentenced to probation for a   crash that killed four and seriously injured two. The boy’s lawyers argued that he was so spoiled that he did not realize that there were limits on his behavior, the now notorious “affluenza” defense. Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican who brought the fraud charges, has applauded Ms. Ortega’s sentence, saying that it “shows how serious Texas is about keeping its elections secure. ” Ms. Ortega said she had voted for Mr. Paxton as well as Mitt Romney, President Barack Obama’s Republican rival in 2012, after being persuaded by the conservative father of her fiancé, Oscar Sherman. The outlines of Ms. Ortega’s offense are mostly undisputed. While living in neighboring Dallas County, she registered to vote before the 2012 election, checking a box on the registration form that certified that she was a United States citizen. After voting in 2012 and 2014, she moved to Fort Worth’s Tarrant County in 2015, where she registered to vote again  —   this time, ticking the box that indicated she was not a citizen. When her registration was rejected, she called elections officials, telling them that she had voted in Dallas. Told that people who checked the noncitizen box were ineligible to vote, she reapplied, this time indicating that she was a citizen. An elections worker who remembered her earlier comment about voting in Dallas became suspicious, and forwarded the application to the authorities. Ms. Ortega was jailed on charges of voting fraud, a felony, and false statements on a registration application, a misdemeanor. State prosecutors argued that her actions and statements showed that she had intended to break the law, although they offered no explanation of why she would have sought to vote illegally. A jury of 10 women and two men convicted her of the fraud charges, but the misdemeanor has yet to be adjudicated. After a month in jail, she was released on bail. Her four children have been placed with an   with whom she has scant contact. Ms. Ortega’s lawyers are casting her as a scapegoat. The case, they say, was manufactured to prop up Mr. Trump’s baseless   claims and an   law by the   Texas Legislature that tightens qualifications for voting. Federal courts have ruled that the latest version of that law discriminates against Latinos and other groups that tend to favor Democratic candidates. In the court of public opinion, they have had some success. Ms. Ortega’s conviction has drawn an outcry in editorials and from advocacy groups. Supporters contributed several thousand dollars to an online   aimed at supporting her family while she was imprisoned. Ms. Ortega’s fate rests not with the public but with a Texas appeals court. Should her lawyers fail to win a new trial, they have one more option: an appeal to the Fort Worth judge who oversaw her trial and conviction. The judge can reduce Ms. Ortega’s   sentence to probation, a decision that would give federal immigration officials legal discretion to rescind her deportation, assuming no other problems crop up. But that option may be closing. On Friday, the Tarrant County criminal district attorney, Sharen Wilson, a Republican who has worked with Mr. Paxton’s office on Ms. Ortega’s prosecution, notified defense lawyers of a meeting on the misdemeanor charge of falsely filing a registration application. A decision to prosecute her on that charge could complicate any effort to avoid her deportation, another of Ms. Ortega’s lawyers, Clark Birdsall, said. A spokeswoman for Ms. Wilson, Samantha Jordan, declined to comment on Ms. Ortega’s case, but said the meeting was a routine status conference. By registering and voting, Mr. Birdsall said, Ms. Ortega hoped to give her children a course in citizenship. “Her whole act of voting was an example to her kids,” he said. “She told them, ‘This is what you’re going to be doing. You have to have your voice heard. ’” Ms. Ortega said they had come away with an entirely different lesson.",0
7844,Huckabee: Resisting the Supreme Court on gay marriage?,"NEW YORK — Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, a likely contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination and a leading voice for Christian conservatives, said Thursday that governors and state legislatures should consider ways to resist a Supreme Court decision that recognized same-sex marriage as a constitutional right.

On USA TODAY's Capital Download, Huckabee likened such a possible decision, on an issue now being weighed by the high court, to the notorious Dred Scott case before the Civil War that ruled African Americans couldn't be citizens. Pushing back against such an opinion ""is not without historical and judicial precedence,"" he said in an interview promoting his new book, God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy, published Wednesday by St. Martin's Press.

If he were still governor, he said, ""I think I would put it before the legislature. I mean, we would ask, 'We have a constitutional amendment in our constitution. Do we want to hold to that? Do we want to put it before a referendum of the people?' I mean, there are a lot of different angles to pursue it. (Or) you could just surrender and say, 'OK, we just agree that the court is right.' ""

Whatever the legal basis for Huckabee's stance — and constitutional scholars question whether there is one — as a political matter his fervent opposition all but guarantees that the issue of gay marriage will be prominent in the GOP presidential debate. While other leading contenders also oppose gay marriage, some of them, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, have said court decisions recognizing the right make it a settled question.

""Rather than just immediately capitulate to nine people in robes, and what it will probably be is five people in robes against four people who disagree ... then you have a very, very divided court,"" he told the weekly newsmaker series. ""Do we really surrender the entire American system of government to five people, unelected, appointed for life, with no consequences for the decisions they make? The founders never intended for there to be such incredible, almost unlimited power, put in the hands of so few people.""

However, Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California Law School, Irvine, said states would have no options if the Supreme Court decided that laws prohibiting same-sex marriage violated the Constitution.

""There have been efforts by states to circumvent or ignore Supreme Court decisions, most notably the intense Southern resistance to Brown v. Board of Education and desegregation,"" Chemerinsky said. ""The Supreme Court made it clear that its ruling was the law of the land. This will be no different.""

The issue has been joined, he noted. ""Already, marriage equality exists in 36 states, mostly because of court decisions, and there has not been the type of resistance Huckabee suggests.""

Still, it is a sign of Huckabee's appeal to the evangelical Christians who are among the GOP's most loyal voters that his new book immediately shot to No. 1 in sales among political books on Amazon and into the top 100 among books of all sorts. In his folksy, conversational style, he unfavorably contrasts New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. — places he dubs ""Bubble-ville"" — with those from the heartland, which he dubs ""Bubba-ville.""

At one point in the book, he discussed how ""goooood"" it is to eat game. ""I'm sorry if that sounds cruel to any vegan readers,"" he added. ""(And are there any? Raise your hands, if you have the strength.)""

In the interview, Huckabee also:

• Acknowledged he was likely to make his second bid for the White House. He also ran in 2008. ""If everything continues to work well and I sense that there is, say, the proper financial and political support, then I think it's a given that that's where the destination is.""

• Predicted former president Bill Clinton would be an asset to his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, if she runs for the Democratic nomination. ""I mean, he had a good presidency. I'm a Republican but I admire good governing.""

• Dismissed as overblown a furor over comments in his new book criticizing Beyonce and Jay-Z for using sexually explicit lyrics, and the president and first lady for allowing their daughters to listen to them. ""I do think they're good parents,"" he said of the Obamas, adding he has some of Beyonce's songs on his iPhone. ""She's an incredibly gifted singer and dancer. She doesn't need to get into the vulgar in order to be successful and influential.""

He also denied charges of hypocrisy, leveled this week by Jon Stewart in a combative interview on The Daily Show, because he had played bass backing up rocker Ted Nugent as he sang ""Cat Scratch Fever,"" a song with sexually suggestive lyrics of its own.

• Discussed reports that the FBI had decided not to pursue civil-rights charges in the police shooting in Ferguson, Mo., saying the Justice Department would have proceeded if it could have found any standing to do so. ""It was obvious that (Attorney General) Eric Holder wanted to be able to bring charges,"" he said. ""It was almost evident from the beginning that he was hoping that they would be able to find some way to indict or bring some charges against officer Darren Wilson.""

Now, he said, ""I hope that (civil rights activist and MSNBC anchor) Al Sharpton will have a rally and apologize for having incited so many people to actions that were hurtful to the people of Ferguson, hurtful to many minority business owners whose businesses were burned and looted because passions were inflamed.""",0
23830, Trump Campaign Manager Gives SICKENING Interview On ‘Enormous Sacrifices’ Trump Made (VIDEO),"It wasn t too long ago that Republican nominee Donald Trump made us feel sick to our stomach when he told Gold Star parent Khizr Khan, the father of a Muslim soldier that was killed defending this country, that he had  made a lot of sacrifices. It was a disgusting claim, as few people have been as entitled as Trump   but his campaign is back at it again, trying to depict Trump as someone who has actually worked hard.On Thursday, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway insisted that the reason people were voting for Trump was because they appreciated all of the sacrifices he made by running for the White House. In a completely delusional interview with CNN s Chris Cuomo, Conway said: Donald Trump is closing with a positive message. He s talking about his love for the country, his love for the people, what he s going to do to help them solve everyday problems. And Hillary Clinton, unfortunately, has gone lower and lower. They re going totally negative. Obviously, the Trump campaign is now ignoring the fact that its entire campaign strategy has been negative, hateful and divisive. Conway s next statement was even more ridiculous, because Trump has tanked horribly with female voters and shown that he has zero respect for them throughout his entire life. Female voters especially don t like that. They feel they deserve and should be respected to have a substantive conversation. Conway called Trump, who has scammed and insulted more people than we can count throughout his campaign,  incredibly gracious and really funny. And he s doing this for all the right reasons. I mean, I think people will look back at this campaign   particularly after he wins on Tuesday   and they ll say, we totally missed how much America just appreciated  how much America appreciated the fact that he and his family made enormous sacrifices to run for president. Really,  enormous sacrifices?  This statement is just as sickening as when Trump mentions that  small  loan of one million dollars that his father gave him as he whines about how hard his life has been as a wealthy white male. Trump and his family basically had riches handed to them, and they haven t used it to do good. Even Trump s charities have failed to give back as much as Trump says they have.Considering she d already made so many false statements, Conway decided to go for the gold when she trashed Clinton and the Democratic Party. She said: I mean, this is not the Democratic Party that you and I grew up in, Chris. It has gone so far to the left, I can t even reach my hand out and touch it. Cuomo deserves an award for keeping a straight face through this. You can watch Conway in action below:Featured image is a screenshot",1

38729,Greek archaeologists clear way for Hellenikon resort,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece welcomed a decision by senior archaeologists to conditionally permit a major tourism project in Athens on Wednesday, saying it cleared the way for the country to turn the site into one of Europe’s biggest coastal resorts. The 8 billion euro ($9.4 billion) project to develop the disused Hellenikon airport site is a key term of Greece’s international bailout and is closely watched by its official creditors and potential investors in the crisis-hit country. Greek developer Lamda signed a 99-year lease with the state in 2014 for the 620-hectare (1,530-acre) area, once the site of Athens airport. But the project has faced delays, partly over a long-running row between developers and those who fear it will damage the environment and cultural heritage. After three inconclusive meetings in recent weeks, the Central Archaeological Council, an advisory body, recommended on Tuesday that about 30 hectares (74 acres) of the 620-hectare plot under the project be declared an archaeological site. “The decision is fine,” Deputy Economy Minister in charge of investments, Stergios Pitsiorlas, told Reuters. “The fact that a small area is declared of archaeological interest shields the whole process from future litigation.” Pitsiorlas said the recommendation meant that archaeologists will have a closer supervision of construction work. Backed by Chinese and Gulf funds, Lamda submitted its detailed development plan for Hellenikon in July, setting off a licensing process which will wrap up with a decree. The Council approved the plan on Tuesday and designated specific areas where construction should not be allowed. It was not immediately clear how the Council’s recommendation could affect Lamda’s construction plan. Lamda said it was waiting to be officially notified over the decision before making any public statement, noting that “the importance of the archaeological findings has been included from the beginning in the company’s undertakings”. It said it should be able to assess the impact of the Council’s decision on its development plan once it has reviewed the resolutions and accompanying diagrams. The recommendation is not binding, however, the culture ministry always respects the body’s decisions. Greece on Monday overcame another hurdle to the project by winning an appeal over objections by forestry officials. Hellenikon has become a major political issue in Greece, which is slowly emerging from a multi-year debt crisis.  Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose leftist party strongly opposed it before coming to power in 2015, is now seen as keen to implement the deal to help boost economic activity and reduce unemployment, the euro zone’s highest.  Referring to the council’s decision, Deputy Foreign Minister Giannis Amanatidis said it was “a complicated process which was resolved in the best possible way”. ",0
6467,"Clinton, judged winner of debate, holds big national lead over Sanders","Aided by her performance in the first Democratic debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton has regained much of the ground she lost during a summer of controversy and holds a dominating lead nationally over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the contest for her party’s presidential nomination, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.

Vice President Biden, who has yet to announce whether he will join the Democratic race in the coming days or weeks, runs third amid signs of slippage over the past month. If he were to decide not to run, the poll indicates that much of his current support would go to Clinton rather than Sanders.

[Read details from the latest Washington Post-ABC News national poll here]

By a wide margin, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents rated Clinton over Sanders as the winner of last week’s debate in Las Vegas. The debate was the first of three events this month that are seen as important tests for Clinton, whose candidacy has been hurt by questions about the security of the private e-mail server and account she used while serving as secretary of state.

On Thursday, Clinton will testify before the House committee that is investigating the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012, which led to the deaths of four Americans. Then, on Saturday, she will join other Democratic presidential candidates at the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Iowa, a quadrennial testing ground that eight years ago provided a significant boost to then-Sen. Barack Obama’s candidacy.

Clinton currently leads the Democratic race with the support of 54 percent of registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. That compares with 42 percent in September, by far her lowest level of support over the past two years, and 63 percent in July.

Sanders runs second at 23 percent, almost identical to his September number. The senator from Vermont, who has tapped energy among those in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, saw his support rise steadily throughout the spring and summer. The latest results mark the first time that his support has not moved from one month to the next.

Biden’s possible candidacy draws the support of 16 percent of Democrats, halting a rise to 21 percent in September. That puts him back about where he was when speculation about a possible candidacy began to ramp up in midsummer.

Without Biden in the field, Clinton’s support jumps 10 points to 64 percent among Democratic-leaning voters. Sanders picks up 2 points to 25 percent.

None of the other candidates included in the poll — former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley, former senator Jim Webb of Virginia or former Rhode Island senator and governor Lincoln Chafee — registered more than 2 percent. The poll was completed before Webb’s announcement Tuesday that he would no longer seek the Democratic nomination.

Nearly two-thirds of Democrats predict that Clinton will be their party’s nominee. That percentage is lower than the last time the question was asked in a Post-ABC poll, which was in late March. At that time, Sanders had not announced his candidacy and therefore was not a significant factor in the race.

More than seven in 10 Democrats say that Clinton has the best chance of the party’s candidates to win the general election in November 2016. Just one in five cite Sanders as the party’s strongest candidate. In a related question, asked of all adults, 37 percent predicted that she would win the general election, while 20 percent say Republican candidate Donald Trump would win.

Among Democrats, Clinton leads Sanders on who is “closer to you” on the issues by 53 to 36 percent and on who “understands the problems of people like you” by 51 to 37 percent.

Clinton’s weakest attribute among those tested with Democrats came on the question of honesty. Asked who in the field is more honest and trustworthy, 42 percent said Clinton and 41 percent named Sanders.

Clinton recently announced her opposition to the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. The new poll found that 50 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents want a president who opposes the pipeline, while 50 percent support Obama’s new trade pact.

Clinton’s positions on the two issues are out of step with the general public. A majority support the Keystone XL pipeline (55 to 34 percent) and a plurality (44 to 32 percent) want the next president to back the trade agreement.

Among Democrats, Clinton has more support with women than men. Her strength among women rose in the new poll after an unexpectedly sharp drop in September. She has more support among voters age 50 and older than among those younger than 50.

Clinton leads Sanders among white Democrats by 49 to 32 percent and among non-whites by 61 to 13. However, white Democrats rate Sanders as more honest and trustworthy. Non-whites say Clinton is more honest.

Clinton’s deep Washington experience as a senator and secretary of state is an asset in the Democratic primary. Among leaning Democrats, 76 percent say they want the next president to have experience in how the political system works. For that group, 64 percent support Clinton, compared with 17 percent for Sanders and 14 percent for Biden.

The Post-ABC poll was conducted Oct. 15 to 18 among a random national sample of 1,001 adults, including land-line and cellphone respondents. Full results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The error margin is plus or minus six points among the sample of 352 Democratic-leaning registered voters.",0
7845,Trump Announces Massive Expansion Plans For NASA,"Trump Presents Plan To Expand U.S. Navy To 350 Ships 
Under the Obama administration, NASA has mostly focused on research and development. Space exploration has ground to a halt, thanks to ridiculous restrictions imposed on NASA by Washington politicians who don’t know the first thing about space travel. 
Trump wants America to lead in space once again, and with that in mind he promised more investment in NASA as well as the expansion of current private-public partnerships to maximize America’s potential. 
“I will free NASA from the restriction of serving primarily as a logistics agency for low-Earth orbit activity,” Trump stated. “Instead, we will refocus its mission on space exploration.”   
Years ago, America led the world in space innovation. Astronauts like Neil Armstrong inspired generations of Americans to shoot for the stars . Science and technology programs flourished because America’s children wanted to achieve the impossible. 
That dream has faded as our government has scaled back space programs over time. NASA used to regularly redefine the word “wow,” but now all it does is maintain the status quo. 
What Trump is promising is a bright future for America. A revitalized space program would create thousand of jobs, spur advanced technological developments and inspire America’s children to achieve the impossible once again. 
That’s what America needs right now.  ",1
41306,Trump pledges fealty to NRA gun lobby,"ATLANTA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump pledged to uphold Americans’ right to possess guns on Friday in a speech that he used to revisit some 2016 election campaign themes from his vow to build a border wall to dismissing a Democratic senator as “Pocahontas.” Trump pledged his allegiance to the powerful National Rifle Association, the country’s leading gun-rights advocacy group, at a convention attended by thousands. Elected in part on a law-and-order platform, Trump was the first sitting president to address the NRA since fellow Republican Ronald Reagan in 1983. “As your president, I will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms,” Trump told thousands of people attending the NRA’s annual convention in Atlanta, Georgia. Trump, whose candidacy last year was endorsed by the NRA, marks his first 100 days in office on Saturday with no major legislative achievements but with a long litany of actions to loosen federal regulations and review free trade agreements. Stymied by his initial bid to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border when Congress balked at funding the initiative, Trump vowed he will sooner or later build the wall, which had been a signature campaign promise. “We need a wall. We’ll build the wall. Don’t even think about it,” he said. Politics and his unexpected election victory on Nov. 8 over Democrat Hillary Clinton also featured prominently in his remarks. Speculating on who might run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, Trump brought up the name of U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and used a derogatory nickname he had adopted for her last year. “It may be Pochahontas, and she is not big on the NRA,” Trump said of Warren, who had once said she had some Native American ancestry. Pocahontas is a legendary Native American figure from the 1600s. Trump later attended a fund-raiser for Republican candidate Karen Handel, who will face Democrat Jon Ossoff on June 20 to determine who will win a House of Representatives seat to replace Tom Price, who became Trump’s health and human services secretary. Trump, at the NRA event, returned time and again to the theme of responsible gun ownership. “You have a true friend and champion in the White House,” he said. “We want to assure you of the sacred right of self defense for all of our citizens.” ",0
23119, Trump Gets DESTROYED On Twitter For His Latest Tweet About Putin,"Donald Trump has made it clear that he has a very large place in his heart for Vladimir Putin, so big in fact, that he s taken his side against fellow Americans.Earlier today, Trump tweeted a response to a statement from Putin:Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: ""In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity."" So true!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2016Well, first off, Hillary won the popular vote, and Trump is in constant denial of that. Also, if the situation were reversed Trump would have thrown a giant temper-tantrum in response. Not to mention the fact he s taking the side of a foreign country against his fellow American people. Of course, how could he be against the man who helped him win the election? Donald Trump has no room to say what s dignified and what s not, in fact, he probably doesn t know what the word even means. Either way, Trump is getting plenty of comments in response to this tweet, and their completely justified.Our next President parroted an attack against his own citizens by a foreign adversary who launched a cyberattacks against the US. https://t.co/RbWDMJ20Ug  Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) December 24, 2016The sad part is, Jon has an excellent point.

47831,U.S. 'very concerned' by media crackdown in Malaysia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday voiced concern about Malaysia’s media crackdown and suggested that the extent of press and Internet freedom in the Asian country could affect prospects for expanded bilateral cooperation. U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said Washington was “very concerned” by Malaysia’s recent restrictions of access to reporting on its domestic current affairs, including last week’s blocking of access to The Malaysian Insider, a news portal. The Malaysian Insider has published reports on the scandal around 1Malaysia Development Berhad and investigations into $681 million deposited into Prime Minister Najib’s personal accounts. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said the news portal had breached laws under the Communications and Multimedia Act, a 1998 law that bars using a website to publish “any comment, request, suggestion or other communication which is obscene, indecent, false, menacing or offensive in character with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass another person.” Najib has denied any wrongdoing over the money transferred into his account, saying that the funds were a political donation and that nothing was taken for his personal gain. The United States is also troubled that the government has failed to provide due process to targeted media groups before blocking access and has begun criminal investigations of  reporters, editors and publishers, Kirby said. “Of equal concern, many Malaysian social media users face charges for postings critical of the government and national leaders,” he added, saying Malaysian officials have spoken about legal amendments “that would further restrict online space.” He said the United States hoped “to expand our cooperation” with Malaysia on shared challenges, adding “in that context, we urge the Government of Malaysia to ensure that all its laws, existing and future, fully respect freedom of expression, including the free flow of ideas on the internet.” ",0
15639,"Philippines Jailbreak Frees More Than 150 Inmates, Prompting Manhunt - The New York Times","MANILA  —   A manhunt was underway Wednesday for more than 150 inmates who escaped from a jail in the southern Philippines after it came under attack by gunmen overnight. One guard was killed and another wounded in the assault on a jail in Kidapawan City on the   southern island of Mindanao, according to Peter Bungat, the warden. The gunmen were thought to be from a bandit group that had broken away from a Muslim rebel organization, Mr. Bungat told a radio station on Mindanao, which is home to a   insurgency. Five of the 158 inmates who escaped from the facility, the North Cotabato District Jail, were later killed in a shootout with pursuing officers, Senior Inspector Xavier Solda, a spokesman for the Philippine Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, told a radio station in Manila. A village official was also killed when he was mistaken for one of the escaped inmates, the police said. Mr. Bungat said the attack began early Wednesday, when the jail’s power supply was cut. Armed men then approached from behind the compound and began firing. “It was well planned,” Mr. Bungat said. He said it was unclear whether any “high profile” inmates were among the escapees. At least a dozen were involved in drug trafficking, according to officials from the jail management bureau. Mr. Bungat said the assault was believed to have been led by a bandit known as Commander Derbie, who once led a faction of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, the Philippines’ largest rebel group. Commander Derbie is widely believed to have broken away from that organization, which has signed a peace deal with the government. Philippine security officials have said that Commander Derbie joined a breakaway group called the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. A spokesman for that group, Abu Misry, denied any involvement in the jailbreak. Ernesto Abella, a spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, said there was no “specific information” as to the identities of the gunmen, “though speculation is rife. ” Three inmates who had been charged with possessing drugs and explosives escaped from the North Cotabato District Jail last August. Eight years ago, three inmates accused of carrying out a bombing also escaped from the jail.",0
37535,Nuclear plan backer denies Inauguration Day text with top Trump aide,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A company promoting a plan for the United States and Russia to jointly build nuclear reactors in the Middle East denied in a letter made public on Monday that its director received an Inauguration Day text message from incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn saying the project was “good to go.” Citing a confidential informant, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives’ Oversight and Government Reform Committee last week said Flynn and Alex Copson, managing director of ACU Strategic Partners, communicated during President Donald Trump’s inaugural address about the project, which would have required lifting U.S. sanctions on Moscow. Thomas Cochran, a business partner of Copson, wrote in a letter to the lawmaker, Representative Elijah Cummings, that the informant’s allegations are “patently false and unfounded.” Reuters was unable to identify the confidential informant or independently confirm the informant’s information that was provided by Cummings.  Copson has not responded to numerous requests for comment in recent months. Cochran attached to the letter records for Copson’s cell phone which, he said, show that he exchanged three text messages on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, none of them with Flynn. “Since Mr. Copson did not receive a text message from General Flynn during the Inauguration, other allegations of the ‘whistleblower’ are equally false and unfounded,” wrote Cochran, who is ACU Strategic Partners’ senior scientist. Flynn is a retired Army general. Reuters and other news organizations have reported that Flynn continued to promote a version of the nuclear project after he began work at the White House. As part of his investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians during the 2016 U.S. election campaign, special counsel Robert Mueller is looking at whether Flynn or other Trump aides tried to influence U.S. policy to improve relations with Russia.   Proponents of the reactors project argued it would provide nuclear energy in the Middle East without the threat of weapons proliferation, improve U.S.-Russia relations and revive the U.S. nuclear industry. Flynn served just 24 days as Trump’s national security adviser before being fired for misleading Vice President Michael Pence about whether he discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to Washington.  He pleaded guilty on Dec. 1 to lying to the FBI about his Russia contacts. Reuters reported that day that documents it had reviewed showed that ACU Strategic Partners bragged after Trump’s Nov. 8, 2016, election that it had Flynn’s backing.  Cummings wrote back to Copson on Monday, requesting that he participate in a transcribed interview “so that our staff attorneys could ask you questions about your relationship and communications with General Flynn.” “It remains unclear why your colleague sent this letter rather than you,” he wrote. Cummings’ office released Cochran’s letter but not the attached phone records.  ",0

35519,VOTE TO KEEP CONFEDERATE FLAG Flying At The Citadel Passes But Sets Up Looming Battle From Dems,"Here we go again the Democrats are trying to erase history at the Citadel. Jim Clyburn is determined to take this fight all the way so the flag will be removed. Don t we have much bigger fish to fry? I would think so In the early hours of Thursday morning, the U.S. House Armed Services Committee voted to keep the Confederate flag flying at The Citadel.The rejection of a Democratic effort to force the military institution to take down the banner atop Summerall Chapel potentially paves the way for a bitter, extended fight on the issue, which is being championed by U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C.U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington State Democrat and ranking member of the committee, offered an amendment to the fiscal 2017 National Defense Authorization Act to bar Reserve Officers  Training Corps funds to any military university that displays the Confederate flag.The only university that falls into that category is The Citadel. The Board of Visitors voted to remove the flag last summer, after revelations that the deadly shooting of nine black parishioners at Mother Emanuel AME Church was motivated by race   an incident which, in turn, prompted the removal of the Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds.But the Board of Visitors says it can t actually take the Citadel s Confederate flag down unless the S.C. state legislature makes changes to the so-called  Heritage Act  that currently stands in the way. Smith acknowledged that his amendment was designed to force state lawmakers to act. The flag still flies, South Carolina has no pressure to change it whatsoever and probably won t,  said Smith,  and that embarrassment continues to fly over The Citadel, where there are presumably African American people at attending, and I think we need something to force South Carolina to do the right thing. The Armed Services Committee chairman, U.S. Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, registered his opposition to Smith s amendment by essentially moving to amend the amendment. He opted for adding language to Smith s original provision to exempt any university which has already voted to take down the flag from having ROTC funds withheld, thereby nullifying the amendment s entire purpose. Bottom line is, I don t think it s fair to punish those folks who are trying to do the right thing, but the folks in the state legislature that is preventing them from doing that now,  Thornberry said.U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, the only South Carolinian serving on the Armed Services Committee, proceeded to read a letter he had received earlier that day from The Citadel s president, Lt. Gen. John Rosa, in opposition to Smith s amendment. The Citadel provides itself on the core values of duty, honor and respect, and moving the (flag) to another location is consistent with those values,  Rosa wrote in his letter to Wilson, a Republican.  But the values also require the college to follow the law. The committee members ultimately voted on Thornberry s alternative language cancelling out Smith s original intent, with all Democrats opposed and all Republican in favor   except for one outlier, U.S. Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona, who sided with the minority party.This conversation will likely continue once the NDAA bill comes before the full House.Read more: Post and Courier",1

8369,"Do Not Forgive the MSM; Alt-Media, Our Job Is Not Over","Jimstone.is 
October 29 2016 

DO NOT FORGIVE THE MSM 

The MSM turned on Hillary. The FBI turned on Hillary. WANT TO KNOW WHY? Because in Florida, where they flipped a HUGE number of votes, Trump still had 68 percent of the vote. Nationwide they did not have the vote scam machines everywhere, and when that got averaged in, Trump took 82 percent of the votes nationwide EVEN WITH THE STOLEN VOTES SUBTRACTED FROM THE AVERAGE. THE FBI, FOX, CNN, EVERYONE ELSE KNEW THE GIG WAS UP, AND IS NOW ONLY MOVING TO SAY ""SORRY"" SO THEY DON'T GO TO JAIL. 

Well, I've got news for you: they are still the same lying despicable malfunctioning trash scum they always were; THEY SHOWED THEIR WORTH, and we would be IDIOTS to forgive them, no matter how badly they burn Hillary. 

CNN is despicable trash; we all witnessed it. NEVER FORGIVE THEM , because they have proven their worth already. No matter what they do, they can't recover from what they have done: they are garbage, a disease, bleach-worthy filth, and I hope Trump ERASES THEM. DITTO FOR ALL of the rest of the MSM, including The Huffington Post, Snopes, ABC-CBS-FOX-YOUNAMEIT – ALL of them are the lowest of filth that is now heading for the darkness of the nearest sewer to get away from the coming bulldozer. 

THE FBI is a trash agency, along with the rest of American intelligence, which only works to serve the enemy for as long as it thinks its head will not be cut off. ALL of the FBI MUST BE DISBANDED and EVERYONE in the FBI should be blackballed and never allowed to work again, with the top echelons jailed for life for treason. THEY LIED ABOUT 9-11 AND THEY KNEW IT , and have proven they serve one purpose: to protect evil. Ditto for the CIA, the NSA, the DHS, the TSA, and all the rest of the trash. All of it needs to go; there is not one fragment of it that should be salvaged. 

So they are all running like rats for cover: they know they blew it, they know they are going to be bagged for heinous crimes against America. Now they are putting on the biggest fakest show the world will ever witness. As if they cared! They never did care, and I hope to God Trump has a memory longer than the average jarhead and bags every last one of them when he has his day. They had BETTER run for the gates and ditch the country just like they said they would if he got elected – because if not, they are heading straight to the gates of justice. 

I would like to thank everyone in the alt-media who made this happen. And I would also like to say that I said it all along as it was and NEVER backed off: Hillary never had more than 8 percent national support. This is something I said repeatedly: that Trump was always 80+ percent supported, and I never wavered and never once posted bullshit like OH, LET'S REJOICE, TRUMP IS AT 51 PERCENT! That was always a trap – a scam, to justify stealing the election – and I called it as it was. 

Our job is not over 

The rot is there. It is deeply rooted, with fungus roots running all the way through the country. One bottle of bleach is not going to do more than spot-clean the surface. We won this battle, and it is NOT time to sit down. The alt-media cannot rest until CNN and all of the rest of the MSM is either bankrupted or jailed. The alt-media CANNOT rest for as long as Google is allowed to wage war on websites like this one by refusing to allow it ads. If this website were allowed ads, it would easily self-fund with $12,000 plus per month (and would probably have more than $24,000 per month). Denial of ads just because someone disagrees and has a monopoly established via full control of various ad firms is a flagrant violation of antitrust laws, and has to be stopped dead cold. 

The alt-media cannot stop until every last criminal in the FBI is jailed BY THE FBI. I am sick of the bait tactics and false flag psyops fronted by that agency: heads have GOT TO ROLL, PILES OF THEM, especially since it has been proven that it was the FBI itself that did the first World Trade Center bombing, with the full intent to bring one of the towers down. That's the type of agency that has got to be shuttered – or we are all toast, Trump or not. Yeah, I know YOU, at the FBI, are reading this. GO TO HELL. 

Our job will not be over until the CIA is cleaned out. Our job is not over until the American Bar Association is disbanded as the criminal bloodsucking hive it is. Our job is not over until the top executives at the medical companies that produced the tainted autism-inflicting vaccines hang with stretched necks. Our job will not be over until every last liberal arts and women's studies department of all universities have their staffs jailed for treason. They gutted the home front in a manner which was horrific beyond belief. Our job is not over until all of America's great libraries are fully restored after being totally wiped out by the Jews, and ALL scientific journals and works once again become fully free and public domain. Our job will not be over until the child-snatching CPS is shut down and their feed for their slave trade is cut off. Our job will not be over until American corporations begin to fight for America, and bring our jobs and American quality back. 

The list of what the alt-media needs to accomplish now that it appears the first huge battle has been won is practically endless. But I believe the alt-media is up to the task, and will succeed as long as ONE THING IS CEMENTED IN STONE: 



JULIAN ASSANGE IS OBVIOUSLY DEAD. 

Consider these facts, and then figure the odds of him being alive: 

1. Wikileaks' DNS server was suddenly pointed elsewhere. That's right: that night, in the wee hours of the morning after Pamela was there (to poison him), police in an armored vehicle showed up at the embassy; and THAT NIGHT, the DNS server pointed to a different IP address for Wikileaks, and GOOGLE updated everything instantly, so the transfer was completely seamless from the real Wikileaks server to the fake Wikileaks server that was at a completely different IP address. 

2. Mr. Assange's subsequent tweets were noticeably more hostile and attacked his most loyal supporters. I reported this repeatedly. 

3. Mr. Assange's tweets regularly misspelled the names of some of his closest friends whom he has known for decades (Gavin McFadyen became McFayden, for example). McFadyen, 76, the director of Wikileaks, was found dead three days after Assange started having mystery problems. This is something I made a huge issue of here. 

4. Streams of disinformation were spewed. 

5. Themes supported by Mr. Assange for years were then knocked down or discredited by his subsequent tweets and communications. Very bad timing with that. Everyone with a brain noticed this, and it lit up the forums and blogs. 

6. ""Body double"" rumors have been circulated and documented. 

7. New, strange, hitherto unknown moderators of Wikileaks have suddenly been installed. 

8. His ""deadman switch"" WAS ACTIVATED BEFORE THE ARMORED VEHICLE EVEN SHOWED UP AT THE EMBASSY, which means Assange probably manually triggered it after he figured out he was poisoned. Much of his stored data and secret website PINs were to be released in the event of his untimely death (I released both deadman switches here, one encrypted and one unencrypted). 

All of this happened right after Pamela Anderson showed up with a lunch that was no doubt poisoned, and the media talked all about how Assange was ""pale"" and ""not feeling well"" when she left, and that he said the food Pamela brought him was ""torture"". Good for a laugh in the inside circles to have this go out on the MSM, no doubt. 

MY TAKE: ASSANGE WAS POISONED, AND THEN REMOVED FROM THE EMBASSY IN AN ARMORED VEHICLE. This was clearly visible in a live feed someone set up that night because something was amiss, and I saw that and stayed up the entire night for it. That is why I so strongly stated that he can't possibly still be at the embassy. Perhaps he got medical care to save him and is now being waterboarded. 

If the new ""wikileak releases"" are real, they are NOT coming from the Wikileaks server – only a re-direct to a different server in the name of Wikileaks. The IP address change proves it, and we can only hope it is white hats doing it. It seems so, but one can only guess.

795,Health Insurers Plan Rate Hikes for Obamacare Exchanges - Breitbart,"Several health insurers will raise premiums by roughly 20 percent on plans sold through Obamacare exchanges. [The biggest Obamacare rate hikes will take place in Delaware, Virginia, and Maryland, which will ask for premiums on average higher than 30 percent in 2018. In Maryland, the average premium from CareFirst will rise by at least 50 percent. Oregon, North Carolina, and Maine health insurers will raise premiums by 20 percent or higher.  The health insurers’ rate hikes reflect the continuing collapse of Obamacare, as many state Obamacare exchanges continue to experience insurers exiting the Obamacare exchanges. Insurers also remain concerned about President Donald Trump’s potential decision to discontinue subsidies for health insurers to lower the cost of premiums. Conservatives argue that the Obamacare subsidies amount to handouts to large health conglomerates. Rick Notter, an executive at Blue Cross Blue Shield Michigan, said, “It’s still a very volatile market. There are so many uncertainties. ” Notter argues that the individual health care market continues to experience turbulence through the uncertainty that comes out of D. C. Republicans, who passed a health care bill through the House, point to insurers’ rate hikes and withdrawals from Obamacare exchanges as fundamental problems with the Affordable Care Act. “The laws of economics were in place long before today. These companies were losing hundreds of millions of dollars,” a White House official said. Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) argues that Republicans’ attempt to repeal Obamacare, as well as President Trump’s threat to remove subsidies to health insurers, created the health insurance rate hikes. Kaine said, “These actions, these statements, these inactions, this uncertainty, has created a huge set of chaos in the individual marketplace leading to instability for insurance carriers, higher premiums, and reduced competition. ” Kevin Lewis, the chief executive at Maine Community Health Options, said that its 19. 6 percent increase in 2018 arises from healthy people exiting the Obamacare markets. “It’s the classic case of people who are healthier jumping out of the market,” Lewis said. “It’s a bit of a   prophecy. ” President Donald Trump, citing that two million Americans have withdrawn from their Obamacare plans since signing up in January, declared that Obamacare is in a “ . ” 2 million more people just dropped out of ObamaCare.

39203,Former Wisconsin sheriff joins pro-Trump super PAC,"(Reuters) - Former Wisconsin sheriff David Clarke, an African-American who criticized the Black Lives Mater movement and was previously under consideration for a position with the Trump administration, has joined a super political action committee that backs the president, officials said on Tuesday. Clarke, 61, will serve as spokesman and senior advisor for America First Action, his office and the political action committee said in two separate statements. “I will help make sure we elect the candidates who will do what they promise in support of President Trump’s agenda,” Clarke said in a statement from his office.  “Just as important, I will see to it that the will of the American people is not derailed by the left or the self-serving Washington establishment,” he added. Clarke, who spoke at the Republican National Convention last summer and campaigned for then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, resigned his job on Thursday and said he would announce his plans this week. The 38-year law enforcement veteran was appointed Milwaukee County sheriff in 2002 and re-elected several times. Although he ran as a Democrat, he moved steadily to the right. “David Clarke is an American patriot, and we are very proud to welcome him,” America First Action President Brian Walsh said in the political action committee’s statement.     Clarke has become one of the most polarizing critics of the Black Lives Matter movement, which grew out of protests against police killings of unarmed black men.     Clarke said in May he was taking a job as assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, but the following month media reported he had withdrawn his acceptance of the job. ",0
3260,Life: The Power Of Unity: This Trump Supporter And Clinton Supporter Held Each Other’s Hair While Vomiting Out Of Election Anxiety,"Email 
If this doesn’t prove what’s beautiful about America, we don’t know what does. 
Politically, Sarah Goodwin and Colleen Cassidy agree on almost nothing. They vehemently oppose the other’s candidate of choice and couldn’t differ more on the direction our country should be heading in. Yet, as this heatedly divisive election cycle comes to a head, these two demonstrated just how powerful a united American people can be when we put our differences aside and work together: Sarah, a Trump supporter, and Colleen, a Clinton supporter, held each other’s hair back while vomiting out of intense election anxiety. 
In a campaign season as contentious as this one, you really have to stop and appreciate moments like this. 
Though Sarah and Colleen come from opposite ends of the political spectrum, you wouldn’t know it when looking into the stall at their polling station in Cranford, NJ, where they both lowered their heads into the same trash can and took turns holding each other’s hair back as they retched over the psychological toll this long, strenuous election’s taken on them. No arguing, no finger-pointing, no name-calling: just dual streams of stress-induced upchuck crescendoing in a duet of dry-heaving. The sight of two people, who have been bombarded for months with messages that the other candidate will completely ruin the country as they know it, patting one another on the back and encouraging each other to get it all out, is all too welcome in an otherwise toxic and polarizing campaign season. 
Need more proof that it’s possible for Trump and Clinton supporters to overcome their shared animosity during this historical moment of anxiety? Colleen even offered Sarah an Altoid once they’d both stopped throwing up and cleaned the barf from their shirts. Further, Sarah graciously let Colleen borrow her eyeliner, which had been smudged due to the tears summoned by a panic attack she experienced while in line to vote. After checking in to make sure the other was feeling all right one last time, each went their separate ways, having found rare common ground with their political opposites in the form of sickening anxiety stoked by the intense fear politics and extremist partisan rhetoric deployed in the 2016 election. 
Yup, the spirit of Abraham Lincoln is alive, knitting a torn nation back together. 
Look at the media and you’ll see interactions between Trump and Clinton supporters portrayed as vitriolic and irreconcilably at odds. But in reality, you’ll find two human beings offering each other their sleeves to wipe the sick from their mouths before they head back out there to get this goddamn fucking thing over with, and that’s worth celebrating.",1
48875,India pledges $25 million for Myanmar's Rakhine to help refugees return,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will provide Myanmar with $25 million for development projects including prefabricated houses in troubled Rakhine state to enable the return of Rohingya Muslims who have fled the area, the foreign ministry said on Thursday. More than 600,000 Rohingya have escaped to Bangladesh after attacks by insurgents on Myanmar security forces in August triggered a military crackdown that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.  The international community demands the Rohingya be allowed to go home in safety, and Bangladesh and Myanmar have begun talks on repatriation, but huge doubts remain about the Rohingya ever being able to return in peace to rebuild homes and till fields. India, which is concerned about the influx of the refugees into its territory, has stressed economic development of the Rakhine region as a way to help lower tensions.  Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar held talks with Myanmar leaders on Wednesday and signed a memorandum of understanding to support development of Rakhine and help create jobs.   This is intended to help the Government of Myanmar achieve its objective of restoration of normalcy in Rakhine State and enable the return of displaced persons,  the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Under this MoU, Government of India proposes to take up, among others, a project to build prefabricated housing in Rakhine State so as to meet the immediate needs of returning people.   India will spend $25 million over the next five years on development of the impoverished region, foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said.  Besides housing, the proposals include building schools, healthcare facilities and building bridges and roads.  India has been trying to promote economic cooperation with Myanmar to try to push back against China s expansive involvement in infrastructure development across south Asia.  Beijing has also stepped into the Rohingya crisis and proposed a three-phase plan including a ceasefire, bilateral talks and then tackling poverty long-term. ",0
17438,A Rising Black Leader Who Pulled Off His Own Fake Obituary - The New York Times,"It is impossible to know what Grady O’Cummings III might have represented to the group of youngsters he was holding court with in this photo taken in September 1963. Mr. O’Cummings, who was photographed with the youngsters outside his office in Harlem, announced the next month that he would seek the Democratic nomination to run for president in 1964. He was one of the first   to run for president. Certainly Mr. O’Cummings must have represented hope and possibility to the boys who had gathered around him that day. Dedicated to economic and political empowerment for blacks, Mr. O’Cummings founded the National Civil Rights Party in 1963 to foster black enterprise and to appeal to liberal whites. He said at the time that the organization had 450 members, with branches in Chicago, Cleveland and Philadelphia. The party designated him its presidential nominee days before he decided to run as a Democrat. It will never be known where Mr. O’Cummings’s ambitious political aspirations might have taken him. His dreams appeared to be cut short when it was reported that he had had a massive heart attack and died at home in November 1969, at just 36. The New York Times ran an obituary about the unexpected death of the promising political novice who, sadly, was lost in his prime. Or was he? Mr. O’Cummings was not quite the determined political    that he seemed. He had faked his death and was very much alive when he bamboozled The Times and The Amsterdam News into publishing his obituary. In fact, this report might well also serve as the newspaper’s long overdue correction. For it was only during the reporting for this article that The Times realized it had written of Mr. O’Cummings’s hoax. This is what actually happened. Just four months after he sent in his obituary to The Times, he    —   at a news conference in Brooklyn, which went unnoticed by The Times. For an explanation of why he faked his death, Mr. O’Cummings said he had simply been trying to elude members of the Black Panthers, who he said had made death threats against him and his family, according to an article about the news conference in The Amsterdam News. “I had to get out because I was trying to protect my family,” The News quoted Mr. O’Cummings as saying. He explained that he had fled to Buffalo, where he remained for months. “My wife, Winnie, was assaulted by four Black Panthers, and it made me very angry. I didn’t go to the police because I am not an informer and didn’t want to get involved. ” The News’s account never explained why he had decided that the threat to his family had diminished enough in just four months for him to   and in such public and dramatic fashion. Perhaps at least partly because he had misled the public, he never attained the political success he sought. Years before, Mr. O’Cummings’s presidential run had proved to be as   as his faked death. In early March 1964, about five months after he was designated the presidential candidate of his National Civil Rights Party, he withdrew and said he would become his party’s candidate for the seat held by Representative John J. Rooney, a Democrat, in Brooklyn’s 14th Congressional District (as reported by The  Times in a brief article). Several decades later, The Times did mention Mr. O’Cummings and his candidacy for City Council, in an article about the 1993 race. Even then, though, the newspaper did not correct the story of his death or run an editor’s note about it. Professionally, Mr. O’Cummings worked in public relations, including as the community relations representative for the Welfare Policemen’s Benevolent Association. He was a native of Greenville, S. C. who graduated from City College of New York. Mr. O’Cummings also was publisher of New York Speakout, a weekly newspaper in Brooklyn, where he lived. And he served as a president of the youth council of the Manhattan division of the N. A. A. C. P. Mr. O’Cummings went on to live a long life. As for his death, it is never too late to set the record straight. The Times can now report with the authority of having seen Mr. O’Cummings’s death certificate that he died of natural causes on June 2, 1996, at the age of 63. It was 27 years after his obituary appeared in this publication. The Times did not publish a second one. This series will be part of a book with additional unseen photographs, and new stories, titled “Unseen: Unpublished Black History From the New York Times Archives,” to be published by Black Dog  Leventhal in the fall of 2017.",0
11877,Report: John McCain Claims Barack Obama Provided Better ’American Leadership’ Than Donald Trump,"  Sen. John McCain ( ) has reportedly told a   newspaper that he believes “American leadership” was better under President Barack Obama than President Trump  —   the latest in a series of shots the failed 2008 presidential candidate has taken at his fellow Republican. [According to the Guardian, McCain was “visibly irked” when asked about comments Trump made last week in the wake of the terrorist attack in London, in which he criticized London Mayor Sadiq Khan for his response to the atrocity.  “What do you think the message is? The message is that America doesn’t want to lead,” McCain said. “They are not sure of American leadership, whether it be in Siberia or whether it be in Antarctica. ” Then, when asked if America’s international standing was better under Obama, McCain reportedly responded: “As far as American leadership is concerned, yes. ” McCain  —   who lost his 2008 presidential bid against   Obama after a campaign in which he repeatedly defended Obama from his supporters’ criticisms  —   has been an outspoken critic of Trump and has refused to tone it down since his fellow Republican took the White House. In a recent tour of Australia, McCain told an audience in Sydney that Trump has “unsettled” allies and Americans alike. “Other American allies have similar doubts these days and this is understandable,” McCain said, according to The Associated Press at the city’s university. “I realize that some of President Trump’s actions and statements have unsettled America’s friends. They have unsettled many Americans as well. ” He went on to urge the Australians to “keep at” the   Partnership deal in the hope that one day “America will decide to join you. ” He also said in an interview with an Australian TV network that Trump makes him “nervous from time to time” and said he was bothered that Trump does not always take the advice of his national security team. “Can I tell you that he does all the time? No. Does it bother me? Yes, it bothers me,” he said. Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York. Follow Adam on Twitter: @AdamShawNY.",0
31107,TOO FUNNY! CHUCK SCHUMER Tries To Lead Liberal Chant… It’s An Epic Fail Just Like His Effort To Block Neil Gorsuch! [Video],"In recent weeks, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has threatened to lead his caucus in filibustering President Donald Trump s nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, often citing a rule that a Supreme Court nominee needs a 60-vote supermajority in order to be appointed.The alleged rule has been debunked by fact-checkers, but Schumer is still holding out, arguing that Republicans would be violating the established norms of the Senate if they were to subject Trump s Supreme Court nominee to a simple up or down vote. If Judge Gorsuch fails to earn 60 votes and fails to demonstrate he is mainstream enough to sit on the high court, we should change the nominee not the rules,  Schumer said in a Wednesday press conference. When pressed by Sinclair Broadcast Group, he acknowledged that there was no hard and fast rule subjecting every Supreme Court nominee to approval by a supermajority, but  we believe in a 60-vote threshold. That belief is different from a rule. And Republicans are now arguing that even though the last four nominees to the Supreme Court were forced to overcome the 60-vote threshold for their lifetime appointments, it is not the standard.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on Wednesday that his Democratic colleagues are invoking a  mythical 60 vote standard that doesn t exist,  because of their 2016 electoral loss.  A 60-vote threshold has never been the standard for a Supreme Court nomination. The 60-vote standard was even debunked by the Washington Post fact-checker two months ago, saying Democrats were using  misleading  and  slippery  language. The claims by Schumer and other leading Democrats earned Two Pinocchios.Via: FOX 57",1
7703,"For Charles Oakley and Knicks, a Long-Simmering Feud Boils Over - The New York Times","Charles Oakley has strong feelings about comped tickets. They are not freebies, he said in a recent interview. Instead, they are the vehicle through which teams show respect for former players. The Knicks have not offered Oakley free tickets for a long time. Worse, Oakley said, is the feeling that the organization has been scrubbing him from its history. This season, for example, the Knicks are celebrating their 70th anniversary, and Oakley has not been invited to participate in any of the events. It seems unlikely that any of that will change now. Mounting losses and a dysfunctional relationship between Carmelo Anthony and the team’s president, Phil Jackson, are no longer enough for the Knicks. On Wednesday night, a franchise with an addiction to needless drama raised the bar when Oakley, one of the franchise’s most beloved former players, was removed from Madison Square Garden in handcuffs after a fracas involving security personnel. If the episode was the product of years of festering animosity between Oakley and James L. Dolan, the team’s owner, then the fallout was swift, with the public and a number of prominent N. B. A. players quickly siding with Oakley. He was charged with three counts of   assault and one count of criminal trespass, all misdemeanors, and came out of the encounter more revered than ever among the team’s many frustrated fans. Even before the Knicks wrapped up their   loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night, the hashtag #FreeOakley began to circulate on social media. A police officer at the Manhattan precinct where Oakley was being processed stood on the steps and shouted, “Free Charles Oakley!” Passing motorists rolled down their windows and complained about how he had been treated. Several N. B. A. stars were quick to express their support for Oakley on social media. The Clippers’ Chris Paul, who was not at Wednesday’s game because of a thumb injury, bristled at the Knicks’ statement on Wednesday night that Oakley needed some sort of help, and Paul described him as “the realest person our league has seen. ” The Chicago Bulls’ Dwyane Wade and the Cleveland Cavaliers’ LeBron James posted photographs of Oakley from his playing days with the Knicks on their Instagram accounts. James called him a legend. And Reggie Miller, a former star with the Indiana Pacers and a player who had legendary playoff duels with Oakley’s Knicks in the 1990s, weighed in on Twitter with vehement criticism of the franchise. He questioned why any N. B. A. free agent would want to sign with the Knicks and “play for an owner who treats the past greats like this or a president who stabs star player in the back?” The latter part of the tweet was, of course, a reference to Jackson, whose efforts to force Anthony out of New York have been overshadowed by the Oakley episode  —   at least for the moment. The Knicks are, by any objective measure, a mess, and Miller may be right that they are taking on a toxic reputation around the league. The Knicks are even making the Nets, with their     record, look like the most stable basketball organization in New York City. Less clear, though, is what actually occurred Wednesday night that resulted in Oakley’s ejection. At the start of the game, Oakley was sitting with several friends, and they were not far from Dolan’s usual seat, which is in the front row in the corner of the court. Accounts of Oakley’s behavior at that point vary widely, with some fans saying they didn’t hear or see Oakley saying or doing anything inappropriate, or trying to provoke Dolan, and others suggesting he seemed somewhat combative. In any case, when security guards approached Oakley, he clearly became angry, unleashing a string of profanities and becoming physical with at least two of them. As he was then removed from the arena, the crowd chanted his name, a moment that may come to symbolize an increasingly disastrous season. Shortly after the encounter, the Knicks issued a statement that ended with the hope that Oakley would get “some help,’’ a suggestion that offended many people in addition to Paul. On Thursday, the Knicks issued a   statement in which they more explicitly stated that numerous Garden employees and New York City police officers had witnessed “abusive behavior’’ by Oakley as the episode unfolded. It dismissed his contention that he had done nothing wrong as “pure fiction. ’’ Madison Square Garden officials provided one employee’s description of the encounter to The New York Times, identifying her as a woman who was an “order taker’’ in the section in which Oakley was sitting. According to the statement by the woman, whom the Garden did not name, Oakley was agitated when he sat down, asking where Dolan was and why security guards were looking at him. She said she urged him to calm down, to no avail. Oakley played for the Knicks for 10 seasons and through much of the 1990s, when the Knicks were a tough, competitive team and Oakley’s determined physical presence near the basket epitomized everything the Knicks were about. Dolan did not become the chairman of the Garden until Oakley had already left the Knicks. Nevertheless, the two men have managed to become adversaries in the years that followed. In a recent interview, Oakley said that he tried to approach Dolan at the 2014 N. B. A.   Game in New Orleans but was rebuffed. Dolan, he said, refused to shake his hand. Oakley said that he was later told that he had said “something in the paper” that had infuriated Dolan. Oakley said he had no idea what he said to offend Dolan. Oakley has been a vocal critic of the team  —   and of Dolan, in particular  —   for years. His insistence that he does not know why the team treats him so poorly is, at the very least, disingenuous. He has been miffed that the Knicks did not offer him a coaching position. He has cursed Dolan through the news media, largely for Dolan’s refusal to meet with him. And he has continued to channel many fans’ frustrations by venting about the team’s poor play. Oakley is no stranger to confrontation. As a player, he once punched Charles Barkley in the face during a preseason game. He was the consummate enforcer in an era of physical play. It has become clear, through some of his actions in retirement, that his approach to the game was really who he is. And that has caused some problems. In 2010, he was involved in a scuffle at a Las Vegas casino that left him with a broken arm. More recently, after Game 7 of last season’s N. B. A. finals, Oakley screamed at security personnel in Oakland, Calif. who were trying to prevent him (with varying degrees of success) from entering the Cavaliers’ jubilant locker room. The Cavaliers had just won their first championship after defeating the Golden State Warriors, and Oakley, who grew up in Cleveland, wanted to join the celebration. “They was just mad they lost,” Oakley said in a recent interview, referring to the Warriors. Friends describe Oakley as loyal, generous and protective. But he is also sensitive to slights, perceived and real. Over lunch with this writer in November, he reflected on his playing days with the Knicks and lamented how the team, he thought, had refused to market anyone except Patrick Ewing. “They probably never sold my jersey in New York until I left,” he said. Oakley added that he still attended three or four Knicks games every season, always paying his own way. And every time, he said, he would be watched by security personnel. He said that Dolan was behind their actions. “Anytime I go into the Garden, they have to call him and tell him where I’m at,” he said. “They got to let him know, ‘Oakley is in the building. ’” He added: “It’s so disrespectful. I bought my tickets. And you’re going to tell someone he can’t walk around?” Oakley sounded most upset when he said that the Knicks had tarnished his relationships with many of his former teammates. Oakley recalled a game at the Garden last season when he bumped into a former teammate near the court. The teammate, Oakley said, apprehensively urged him to keep his voice down. “The guys I played with,” Oakley said, “they can’t even talk to me or be around me. ” On Thursday, in an interview on ESPN Radio, Oakley apologized for his role in Wednesday’s episode. “I feel sorry for the fans,” he said. The fans, in turn, seem to be on Oakley’s side. Welcome to the world of the Knicks.",0
7120,"FEAR OF TRUMP: BUSH, OBAMA, CLINTON ALL BUYING PROPERTY IN NON-EXTRADITION NATIONS","Email 

It appears Bill and Hillary Clinton are making plans to flee the country in the event Donald Trump wins this election. 
Reports are circulating that the Clintons have transferred 1.8 Billion dollars from the Clinton Foundation to the Qatar Central Bank, via a facilitation/abatement of JP Morgan Chase & Company for reasons not revealed. 
This move of such a large sum of money to the country of Qatar says in itself, Hillary Clinton knows she is going to lose the election, and she doesn’t plan to allow herself to be prosecuted for various high crimes and treason under a Trump Administration. 
The country of Qatar happens to be one of a handful of countries that does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, thus would be a perfect place for her to run to in escaping justice. 
Donald Trump has said many times during his campaign and at the Presidential debates that once he gets into office, he intends to prosecute her on various high crimes from her latest crimes of sending classified material via a personal e mail server. All the way to gun running to terrorist groups in Syria resulting in the deaths of 4 Americans in Benghazi. 
Apparently, Hillary is not the only person in Washington who has made plans to escape justice under a Trump Administration. John Kerry has quietly been selling his property in the US for millions of dollars of late, with an announcement of the sale of his $25 million dollar Nantucket mansion in June 2016, as well as the sale of his yacht for $3.9 million in July 2016. 
President Barack H Obama has also apparently been making exit plans with his purchase of a $4.9 million dollar seaside mansion in Dubai in January 2016, another non extradition country. 
Snopes and other supposed fact checking sites have debunked both the story of Obama’s purchase of the mansion and the firing of Rear Admiral Rick Williams. However, over the last several months, these sites have been busted for lying in trying to debunk such information as the before mentioned, when in fact the information is true. 
Snopes and other sites try their best to keep incriminating information from being believed, but the truth has a way of coming out on its own, as it always has.",1
44238,Trump team considering new non-nuclear sanctions on Iran: FT,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s transition team is examining proposals for new non-nuclear sanctions on Iran, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing congressional sources who have been in contact with the president-elect’s team. Officials with Trump’s team have been in touch with fellow Republicans in Congress, where they hold the majority, to discuss possible sanctions separate from last year’s Iran nuclear deal that could focus on its ballistic missile program or human rights, the sources told the FT. “They (Trump team members) are already looking closely at their options — and that very much includes non-nuclear sanctions,” a congressional official told the media outlet. The deal that was reached last year between Iran, the United States and five other world powers lifted some sanctions against Tehran in return for restrictions on its nuclear program. On the campaign trail, Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, vowed to tear up the agreement with Iran and negotiate a better one. He also criticized sanctions that blocked U.S. companies from Iran and noted the difficulty of discarding a deal with U.N. backing. The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed a 10-year extension of sanctions against Iran that lawmakers and the Obama administration have said would not violate the nuclear agreement reached last year with Iran. On Friday, Iran threatened retaliation, saying the vote breached the deal. The measure, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives last month, now goes to the White House for President Barack Obama to sign into law. That would delay potentially tougher actions until next year. Several Republican U.S. lawmakers already have introduced proposals for additional sanctions on Iran separate from the nuclear pact or plan to do so. “The big difference next year is that we will go from a White House that did everything it could to block these bills to a White House that will be in favor and maybe even sponsor some of these proposals,” a congressional source told the Financial Times.

20081, God Bless Whoever Is Photoshopping These Hilariously Long Ties Onto Donald Trump,"Every once in a while, the perfect pun comes along. You know them when you see them. They re so good, you have to come back and use them again and again. And in situations of discomfort, or fear, or even danger, a pun can be a lifesaver, or an icebreaker, or just something to remind everyone that not everything is serious all the time.Donald Trump presents America with those situations every day. And although there are plenty of good jokes and puns about his hair or his complexion or the likelihood that he has, um, nether regions that match his abnormally tiny hands, none of those are actually perfect. They re physical digs, and those are a dime a dozen.No, the funniest jokes about Donald Trump have to do with ironic things he does, like owning a brand of steaks and famously eating them in a way that makes Mr. Creosote himself, well, sick.But the funniest one of them all rolls right off the tongue because it s already a part of our everyday vernacular. We say  Trump s ties to Big Oil,  and  Trump s ties to Putin s Russia,  but really we could just stop at Trump s Ties: They re f*cking hilarious. And nothing is funnier than taking something that s already funny and making it even better.

54326,"Catalonia refuses to renounce independence, separatist protesters rally","BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia refused on Tuesday to bow to the Spanish government s demand that it renounce a symbolic declaration of independence, setting it on a political collision course with Madrid later this week. Madrid has threatened to put Catalonia, which accounts for a fifth of Spain s economy, under direct central rule if its regional government does not abandon independence by Thursday. But Catalonia s government rejected Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy s deadline.  Giving in forms no part of this government s scenarios,  Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull said.  On Thursday, we won t give anything different than what we gave on Monday.  Spain s biggest political crisis in decades worsened on Monday night when Madrid s High Court jailed the heads of Catalonia s two main separatist groups pending an investigation for alleged sedition. The Catalan government accused Madrid of taking  political prisoners  and tens of thousands of protesters gathered along Barcelona s Diagonal Avenue to call for their release. People held up lighted candles, whistled and shouted  freedom  and  out with the occupying forces .  There should not be political prisoners in a democratic country in the 21st century. This country is not democratic. I m here to support democracy,  said Alicia Cabreriza, a 26-year-old computer programmer from Barcelona. The protests ended peacefully at around 2000 GMT. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, in a tweet following the detentions, said:  Sadly, we have political prisoners again.  The phrase was an allusion to the military dictatorship under Francisco Franco, when Catalan culture and language were systematically suppressed. It carries an emotional resonance given fascism is still a living memory for many Spaniards. Justice Minister Rafael Catala hit back, saying the jailing of the leaders of the separatist groups, the Catalan National Assembly and Omnium, was a judicial, not a political, decision.  We can talk of politicians in prison but not political prisoners,  he said.  These are not political prisoners because yesterday s prison ruling was due to a (suspected) crime.  The crisis has deepened divisions at the heart of Spain s young democracy, underlining the complex sense of nationhood in the euro zone s fourth largest economy. In Madrid, unionists drape their homes in the national flag, while Barcelona apartment buildings are festooned with Catalan flags. Street protests of hundreds of thousands of people have been held on both sides of the divide, including in Catalonia.  They ve crossed a line,  said Eulalia L pez, a 54-year-old office worker in Barcelona. She said she and her colleagues would come out onto the streets if Madrid went ahead and took control of the region. European capitals and financial markets have looked on with mounting alarm since Oct. 1, when Catalan authorities held a referendum on independence in defiance of a Spanish court ban. ANC leader Jordi Sanchez and Omnium chief Jordi Cuixart are accused by prosecutors of helping to orchestrate pro-independence protests that last month trapped national police inside a Barcelona building and destroyed their vehicles. That same incident also led to Catalonia s police chief, Josep Lluis Trapero, being investigated for sedition. He is accused of failing to order his force to rescue them from the building. He has not been detained but the High Court banned him from leaving Spain and seized his passport. A string of companies, including two major lenders, have decided to move their headquarters outside Catalonia since the referendum. Spanish police launched a violent crackdown in an effort to thwart the referendum, using rubber bullets and batons on voters in scenes that shocked Spain s European neighbors. Catalan officials say 43 percent of voters still managed to cast ballots with 90 percent in favor of breaking away. Many unionists, however, obeyed Madrid and did not vote. Spain s constitutional court, which had suspended the referendum, said on Tuesday the law passed by the Catalan parliament to hold the vote was void because it broke dispositions of Spain s 1978 constitution. One of Catalonia s major foreign investors, Volkswagen, said on Tuesday that its Spanish division, Seat, had decided to delay announcing the name of its forthcoming model. Seat, based in Martorell in Catalonia, had planned to announce the name of its 2018 sport-utility vehicle this month, about a year ahead of the 7-seat model s launch.  With the entire Spanish media focused on politics at the moment, we have decided to find a better time,  a Seat spokesman said, adding the division had also delayed the announcement of an innovation and digitisation agreement. He did not elaborate. ",0
11856,Comment on Texas Police Arrest Trump Voter for Wearing “Deplorable” T-Shirt by Terry,"Posted on October 30, 2016 by Tim Brown 
On Monday, a man who voted for Donald Trump was arrested for wearing a T-shirt that referenced Hillary Clinton ‘s comments about Trump supporters being “ deplorables ” to the polls. 
Brett Mauthe, 55, was arrested after he went to the polls wearing a pro-Trump hat and a shirt that read, “ basket of deplorables .” 
According to KSAT 12, Mauthe removed his hat at the request of those who were overseeing the polls. However, since the t-shirt did not violate the election code, he refused to turn it inside out nor remove it. 
Subsequently, he was arrested and charged with electioneering. 
KSAT 12 reports : 
Bulverde police Chief Gary Haecker confirmed the arrest but declined to release details. Instead, he deferred to Comal County’s election coordinator, Cynthia Jaqua. 
Jaqua said the offense of electioneering isn’t limited to people who stand outside polling places holding signs. Violations can be committed by voters as well. 
“It can mean a T-shirt, a button, a hat, you know?” she said. “Anything related to the voting, the party, the candidate.” 
Jaqua declined to release specific details about Mauthe’s arrest. 
Jaqua is quoted by My San Antonio : 
It’s in the election code. Electioneering is prohibited within a 100-foot marker. You cannot express views for or against a candidate or political party by wearing buttons, T-shirts, hats, whatever else or carrying signs,” she said. 
Most people who make the mistake manage to avoid going to jail, she added. 
“Every election we have to advise people. Even if it’s a school bond issue. They wear candidates’ shirts and we just have to remind them. ‘Please go into the restroom and turn it inside out.’ This is the first time I recall someone getting arrested,” she said, during two decades working at the county election office. 
“A gentleman did walk in a little while ago with a slogan for Trump, and when I asked him to please take it off, he was real nice, and took it off,” she added, while working a polling site Thursday afternoon in New Braunfels. 
So, according to this nonsense, a perfectly legal shirt could be worn to the polls one day, but if a politician makes reference to the phrase on that shirt it becomes illegal to wear it to the polls the next day? This is utterly ridiculous. 
My question on all of that is, what happened to free speech? Is that recognized as a God-given right in the First Amendment? I mean, I realize that the Constitution is to restrict the federal government, but honestly, shouldn’t the states recognize the right of free speech, even in a polling place? Seems to me those kinds of laws stifle the very thing you are electing representatives to ensure are protected. 
Other voters agree with me. 
“I don’t feel like you should be preaching to anybody, but I do feel like you should be able to wear a shirt if you want and if it has the candidate,” Georgina Pereida said after casting her vote. “I’m kind of shocked, because I think that’s part of the freedoms that we’re voting for.” 
Jose Tovar claims that you should know the rules and regulations if you are 18 and vote. Again, I ask, why are there laws and regulations restricting this freedom of speech? It’s not inflammatory. It isn’t a lie. It isn’t slander. What’s illegal about it? 
I’ll tell you, politicians want to control people, and this is one of many means they use to do that. This is what happens when you don’t hold your elected officials accountable for the stupid regulations they impose. 
Mauthe decided to not comment anymore after his story began to be altered in the media. 
“The reason I’m not going to talk any more to the media is that the story gets twisted around, and I don’t want to give you any comment,” he said . 
The charged of electioneering is a class C misdemeanor.

33823,HILLARY TO OBAMA: “call off your f–king dogs”,"According to insider, and author Edward Klein, Hillary took on Barack Obama over his involvement in exposing her email scandal several months ago. Many Americans are wondering if Obama is stonewalling the FBI s  investigation, or if in fact, he is encouraging the investigation, hoping it will take her down.  This isn t the first report of Hillary behaving in a manner that is, shall we say,  un-presidential?   According to White House insiders, it seems that Bill has been on the receiving end of Hillary s rage more than once as well   An enraged Hillary Rodham Clinton blew up at President Obama, demanding he  call off your f king dogs  looking into her emails during a tense Oval Office meeting, according to a new book.The book,  Unlikeable: The Problem with Hillary,  says the former first lady was furious at what she believed were damaging leaks by Obama aides that led to investigations of her use of a private email server as secretary of state. So she went right to the top to settle the matter.Clinton requested a meeting with Obama, against the advice of hubby Bill Clinton, believing  she was being persecuted for minor, meaningless violations,  author Edward Klein writes.Clinton initially took a friendly approach during the meeting and Obama reacted as if he didn t know what she was talking about, the book claims. He was almost being deliberately dense,  a Clinton source said.  It really angered her. Clinton lost her temper and called the president by his first name in an emotionally driven break with White House decorum, according to the book. What I want for you to do is call off your f king dogs, Barack!  Clinton allegedly barked at Obama, according to Klein s account, which cited sources close to Clinton and Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett.The president was so stunned by Clinton s disrespectful demands, he needed a moment to compose himself, the book claims.Obama then responded,  There is nothing I can do for you one way or another. Things have been set in motion, and I can t and won t interfere. Your problems are, frankly, of your own making. If you had been honest . . . Klein reports Clinton interrupted,  There are always haters out there to get the Clintons. The Democratic 2016 front-runner is said to have later regretted her tirade against the president   not for the disrespect she showed, but for the weakness she displayed.Nick Merrill, Clinton s spokesman, called Klein s account  bulls t. Another book? Someone should do a book about Ed,  said Merrill.  They could call it  Bulls t: The Problem with Anything Ed Klein Writes. The only true thing about him is his consistent and utter lack of a relationship with the facts,  Merrill said.  He has more hair than credibility, and the man is bald. So we re not going to get down in the gutter with him and his outrageous fabrications.  Via: NYPHillary s on a mission to be a softer, warmer, funnier candidate   but according to a new book, the real Hillary Clinton is so volatile and prone to violent outbursts that she terrorizes staff, Secret Service agents and even her own husband. Hillary Clinton has a long history of being domestically violent with Bill,  Stone writes.  Hillary has beaten Bill, hit him with hard objects, scratched and clawed him, and made him bleed. ",1
3320,John Kirby and the US State Department Blatantly Support Terrorists - Henry Kamens,"John Kirby and the US State Department Blatantly Support Terrorists 
Kirby and the State Department serve as apologists and white-washers for barbarism Originally appeared at New Eastern Outlook 
The US government, together with the MSM, blatantly supports terrorists. The nexus between politicians, terrorism and the media is well known to the intelligence community. However these links and cozy connections are usually written off as mere coincidence. We are told that the arms and funding which they illegally receive are but an accidental by-product of supporting “freedom fighters,” and that no one planned for these groups to be transformed into terrorist organisations. 
This is but the tip of the iceberg as nowadays Radical Islamists are now just considered as rebels by the main stream media or described as “spoilers” by the US State Department, whose main spokesman, John Kirby just recently referred to Al-Nusra in East Aleppo as a spoiler to the ceasefire in Syria . 
The way the US government and the MSM support terrorists is nothing that should come as any surprise. And this is not accidental, because a specific spokesperson has been appointed to run this media spin operation. 
Meet John Kirby – the man who will call terrorism by anything other than what it is 
Retired Rear Admiral Kirby is the official US State Department Spokesperson. He is a graduate of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, rather than the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, and holds degrees in history, international relations, national security and strategic studies. He has worked in information-based roles throughout his armed forces career, though usually speaking to the goverment rather than the public, and the steady, year-on-year increases in US military spending show he has been very effective in this role. 
Kirby was once a Pentagon spokesman. He used to be a Pentagon spokesman, well positioned to present sensitive information in non-controversial packages for mass public consumption. The Pentagon is hardly likely to tell us the truth about the things the public should be interested in: rows between generals, unauthorised or illegal actions or what the generals really think about the politicians they serve. But it has a press service regardless, so has to turn all that into something benign and equally interesting, as far as security clearance will allow. 
This is why, under Kirby’s direction, radical Islamist groups which commit acts which meet any definition of terrorism, even if you agree with their cause, are now referred to simply as “rebels” by the mainstream media, or “spoilers” by the State Department. Listen to this example: Kirby referring to Al-Nusra as a “spoiler” to the ceasefire in East Aleppo . 
He also has a neat trick for minimising terrorism: he refers to Daesh by the silly name Dash, a word Americans are familiar with from athletics, which conjures up images of educated young people in running gear rather than hooded terrorists murdering, beheading and marauding. His statements about Dash are really questionable. 
People probably think they are funny, what about those families of the beheaded people and those killed by ISIS, would they find it funny? It is sick. Readers should be disgusted with Kirby. 
Perhaps these guys think they have the terrorists controlled and managed. However when you tell the public we are at war with radical Islamists, and Al Nusra and others are on the terrorist watch list, why are these “national security experts” allowed to give them the a pass as if allies? The key is that we have allies that are radical Islamists who have attacked us and lots of others. Those allies are supporting the conflict in Syria . 
Western governments are always telling their public that we are at war with radical Islamists, and that Al Nusra and other groups are designated terrorists and will be eliminated (they are on a kill list). All kinds of actions are taken in the name of fighting terrorism, and Western soldiers are sent to die in faraway places doing it. 
So why is Kirby, presented as a “national security expert”, allowed to talk about them as if they are cuddly allies, or so insignificant that they are hardly worth the billions being spent fighting them? 
Terratwitter army 
Wars are by definition controversial, and always attract comment. Everyone has an opinion about a given conflict, and an important point, as they see it, to make. So there is always an endless stream of people who could be called upon to comment in the media. The only way to give any credibility to the contributor chosen is to present them as having some particular qualification, and Kirby’s title unquestionably gives him one. 
There will also be those up close to the action who disagree with anything Kirby says, including many of the troops the State Department has sent to fight in these conflicts. However there is more than one way to skin a cat. 
If Homeland Security wants to track down some actual terrorists then they should look at the source of Twitter feeds, and you will find all shapes and forms, many are members of the Islamist Front. It is clear that even some very prominent main stream journalists are actually supporting “rebels” by engaging with them in these learned exchanges. 
Have you ever noticed how certain articles and statements attract a large number of comments saying the same thing? These are allegedly from members of the public, and therefore by inference “neutral”, the response of the man or woman in the street rather than an interested party. However this “vox pop” system is easy to manipulate, and there is plenty of evidence this is actually happening.. 
Many of the Twitter feeds and comments about conflicts involving terrorists, allegedly from “the general public”, are actually from members of the Islamic Front, and can be traced back to them. One example is the Twitter account Monther@amirramzi. Yet mainstream journalists do not call these individuals out as such. They engage with them as if they are impartial observers whose observations prove the points made in their articles, which the commenters just happen to have read, amongst the dozens available at any given time, when they have plenty of other things to do with their lives. 
A State Department Spokesman has a long reach. You have to have a lot of weapons in place to take on the Pentagon, even in a verbal battle. Are we to believe that all these journalists are working with the Islamic Front independently, without help from above? 
Too good for their own good 
No one wants to live under a repressive regime. Consequently it is very easy to convey the notion that a “rebel” is simply a decent person fighting against injustice, as every individual likes to think they themselves are. People tend to make this connection without looking any deeper, and it takes a lot more effort than most casual observers are willing to make to go into the details of any conflict, and build a counter-narrative to the one presented by the mainstream media. 
The term “rebel” is used to cover all kinds of combatants in Syria. It includes both the “moderate opposition” and self-avowed terrorists. In order to make this fiction stand up, a lot of claims need to be made and a lot of things not reported, as they would counter the picture of a homogenous group of decent people taking a stand which is so obvious it does not need to be explained. 
It is rarely reported that the moderate opposition was persuaded to reject a UN plan to kick out Al Nusra, who are as much a threat to the ambitions of the moderate opposition as the Syrian government is. The opposition to Assad is now forcibly led by the terrorists the West claims to be fighting, because the more moderate forces have been subjected to it by the same West. This is why Kirby refers to Daesh as Dash – he is implying that the moderate forces are fully in agreement with it, and this somehow makes it something other than a terrorist group, in the same way Al Qaeda has been partially rehabilitated by saying its name over and over again until it becomes as familiar as breakfast to the reading public. 
Similarly the word “Christian” is bandied about for an American audience which is increasingly influenced by the religious right which mushroomed as a backlash to failed liberalism. Kirby and his assistants claim that Christians are being persecuted by Assad the Muslim, without going into exactly who is meant by “Christians”, and what the ramifications of holding that faith are. 
Most Syrian Christians describe themselves as Orthodox, but they are split into two very different groups. One is under the Patriarchate of Antioch, based in Damascus, and the other is under either the Jacobite Syrian church or the Nestorian Assyrian church, which have been outside the mainstream Orthodox communion since the 5th century. Politically these are very different animals – the Church of Antioch uses Arabic in its services as part of a deal with the state for protection, whereas the Syrians generally use Syriac and the Nestorians Aramaic. Nor do they receive the same protection, being treated as suspicious minorities by the Syrian state. 
It is this which lies behind the kidnapping and ongoing detention of two bishops, the Syrian Church’s Archbishop John Ibrahim and the Church of Antioch’s Metropolitan Paul Yazigi, who have been held by ISIS since 2013. This is intended to convey the idea that all Christians are the same, and all must therefore hate Assad. We are told that the whereabouts of these two bishops are unknown, but we were told the same about Terry Waite, the Church of England peace envoy who was held captive in Beirut for five years by the Islamic Jihad Organisation. 
On that occasion, with all the sophisticated weapons targeting systems and intelligence at its disposal, the West couldn’t find one captive in a city its raids demonstrated it knew backwards. Bishop Paul is the Metropolitan of Aleppo, strangely enough. 
Too many friends to be true 
The radical Islamists presented as cuddly flies in the ointment by Kirby are sponsored by external governments. We are often told that these include those of Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar. Many questions have been raised in Western countries about having state sponsors of terrorism as allies, and what those states’ real attitude to terrorism therefore is . Minimising the actions of these groups is therefore a domestic political imperative, not merely a foreign relations or security one, for Western governments. 
This is why Channel 4 News published the report “Aleppo – Up Close With The Rebels” on October 5th. It was an attempt to promote known war criminals and child murderers and thus cleanse their actions, and those of the governments who support them and supply them with the means of committing them. When people started recognising certain faces in the video, and connecting them to actions which had caused journalists to question the US government’s support for this particular rebel group, Channel 4 removed its own report, most unusually . It has not however changed its editorial policy, and presents other groups with similar records in the same way in spite of this. 
There is also a connection with John Kerry’s recent discussions with Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir. It is known that the 28 classified pages of the US government’s official 9\11 report, kept from public view, deal with the role Saudi Arabia played in those attacks. Now Kerry and al-Jubeir are trying to prevent the new Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act from having any effect. 
If it is actually enacted, JASTA will restrict sovereign immunity and make it easier for individuals to prosecute the Saudi state over 9\11, on the basis of the official report. It will also make it easier for other countries to pass parallel legislation which will result in the US being prosecuted for its own actions. This may explain why Obama vetoed the bill, and it was only passed over his veto. 
Now Kerry is trying to fix it so that the bill never comes into effect . If it was enacted, it could have a significant effect on future conflicts by enabling those who believe the actions of a sovereign nation, such as Syria, are criminal to pursue them through legal rather than military avenues. This is the option most “moderate” groups would doubtless prefer. This gives the US military-industrial complex, the only people to profit from any war, every motive for presenting radical terrorists as reasonable, sensible people doing a sensible thing. 
Everyone wins except the future 
Most terrorist groups would be equally radical in behaviour but not be able to achieve as much if just let to their own devices, as they would have neither the weaponry nor the intelligence support. The only reason terrorists who are happy to be martyred by the Western infidels accept their support is because it somehow legitimises them, and they can hope for future favours. 
Menachem Begin, former Israeli PM and Nobel Prize Winner for Peace, was still wanted in the UK for a Zionist bombing when he attended the Leeds Castle Middle East peace negotiations in 1978, but by then enjoyed the dignity of then being a Prime Minister rather than a terrorist, because the West said so . 
John Kirby is still serving the purposes of the Pentagon by presenting terrorists as reasonable, insignificant forces. Not only is he continuing the US sponsorship of terrorism by doing this, he is justifying the billions spent on fighting this apparently insignificant threat. Now the Pentagon can have unlimited funds to spend on anything it can sell to the public. 
Isn’t this a wonderful picture once you connect the dots? “US mainstream media — the playground of spooks and hacks. A propaganda arm of the regime indeed — but that’s not nearly all of it ….” 
Seems the terrorists have jokes of their own, and they are no laughing matter. Enemies are easy to manufacture, same as “manufacturing consent”, especially when you know your audience. It is also easy to turn them into friends in the same way. All you need to do is co-ordinate the effort like a military campaign. 
Who better than John Kirby to tell us what’s what before we have the time to work it out for ourselves?  ",1
9276,Comment on 6 Things Indian Guys Have To Understand When Learning Game by Game Is A Modern Rite Of Passage That Helps Turn Boys Into Men,"Home This Month Popular 6 Things Indian Guys Have To Understand When Learning Game 6 Things Indian Guys Have To Understand When Learning Game February 3, 2013 164 Comments Culture 
As a guy of Indian ethnicity there are some obstacles you have to overcome in order to have a balanced game. Circumstances can dictate what these are but following my last post a red pill infused Indian pal of mine and myself had a conversation about what these obstacles are: 1. Let go of limiting beliefs about being an Indian in the Western world 
What do I mean by “limiting beliefs”? There is a particular mindset among Indian guys that they can only get with Indian girls. You must let go of these fears dictating that your ethnicity holds you back in what you can do. Being Indian does not mean you have to work in IT, accounting, business, construction or own a corner shop as in the same way it does not mean you have to date Indian girls. 2. Let go of your mummy’s sari 
It’s something I’ve noticed among the large Indian community here in London: there are a large number of mummy’s boys, men who are afraid to stand up to their mothers and what they want themselves. No one wants to disrespect their parents but also at the same time standing up for what you want should be your primary objective. Many a man will ‘settle’ with their girlfriends due to pressure from their mothers. As one acquaintance said, he preempted conflict by just doing what his mother wanted, even though he does not love the girl he married. 3. Let go and expand beyond your Indian comfort zone 
Your extended family plays a large part of your life (not a bad thing), but a lot of guys also have their friends circle exclusively Indian. Expand your knowledge, gain new friends, travel, and learn new languages. It’s a difficult transition to move from becoming over reliant on this little setup to independence from all influence, but it can be done and it will benefit your internal well being. The thing to remember is you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with. It is highly likely none of your existing five friends will agree with your path into game. They will tell what is ‘best for you’ but in essence this is them subconsciously pulling you back down to their value as you increase your own. 4. Stop putting white women on a pedestal 
White women are easy, white women are fun, white women are flirts, white women are great at sex or white women are sluts. Whatever white women are, as an Indian guy you must stop putting them on a pedestal for being all these sexually related things that you think Indian girls are not. There is no magical things that white women do that others do not. Besides, there is not a certain place in the world where white women will see you and jump on your cock as there is not a certain Bollywood film that will make a white woman gush all wet and demand you ravage her Aryan style. White woman pedestalization can be categorized as an inferiority complex displayed by Indian men. Stop thinking you’re inferior to any woman regardless of her ethnic/racial origins. 5. Understand that Indian girls are not different and are not more chaste 
Being constantly around these Indian girls at family gatherings, community events and religious events makes you programmed into believing that you will marry one for certain because of their chaste and low promiscuity. A strong belief that Indian girls don’t ride the cock carousel is blind faith because they do. In fact, all women in the western world do regardless of culture and their strong family traditional values. They are women, they get pussy tingles to the same game as white, black, Asian, orange, maroon and kiwi women. They have the same subconscious processes as all women that help them place a value on a man and inevitable slamming and spunk gobbling if he passes with flying colors. In a Western society these girls have the same external pressures and influences that appeal to their inner slut as much as any other woman. Your objective as a man is not to fall into the line of romantic thinking that they are different. 6. Do not be afraid of The Man 
There’s a man, a dominant man, somewhere in your family. He dictates, he dominates, and he makes the decisions. You have a fear of causing him displeasure. You do as he says as he’s done the leading since your father emptied his ball sack into your mother. Stop. As much as a lot of Indian men have pressures from being mummy’s little lad, there’s plenty of them that disintegrate under the pressure of their fathers or uncles. Avoiding conflict is prevalent in your attitude, you do as you are told even though your mind is telling you this is not in your interest and possibly not in the wider interests of those close to you but you do it, as Uncle or Dad has told you to. 
No one is telling you to fight, but start slowly, speak out, say what you think is best for you, get out of your shell and decide how you will live your life, not how Dad thinks you should live your life. You might be scared of the conflict and dissuade yourself from it but trust me when you finally grow some balls and exude some confidence and ability in yourself, these men will respect you, see you as equal, and place trust in your decisions.

6533,Why Democrats are anxious,"(CNN) Donald Trump's reversal on the ""birther"" controversy is turning attention -- at least for the moment -- from a major shift in the presidential race.

The battle for the White House -- dominated by Hillary Clinton only weeks ago -- is tightening dramatically, a nerve-wracking turn for Democrats that sets up what could be a nail-biter election in 52 days.

A cascade of new polls this week suggest close contests in key states such as Virginia -- the home of Clinton's running mate -- and Michigan, where Democrats have won every cycle since 1992.

Nationally in CNN's poll of polls , Clinton stands at 43% to Trump's 41%. In the must-win states of Florida and Ohio, Trump and Clinton are deadlocked in this week's CNN/ORC poll, as well as several other surveys.

In Iowa -- a state President Barack Obama won twice -- Trump leapt to an 8-point lead among likely voters over Clinton in a Monmouth University poll released Thursday (his largest lead yet in a battleground state). And in Virginia, Clinton and Trump were virtually tied at 40% to 37%.

Of course, the 2016 campaign has plenty of twists ahead that could once again reshape the race in an instant. The latest came Friday when Trump ended five years of pushing conspiracy theories about Obama's birthplace and finally acknowledged he was born in the United States. And the first presidential debate, which will likely be a pivotal moment for both campaigns, is nine days away.

But the recent polls underscore concerns about the effectiveness of Clinton's strategy, which has centered on convincing voters Trump is unfit to be commander in chief, as well as her ability to lift vulnerable House and Senate Democrats in November with the same effectiveness as Obama in 2008 and 2012. The Democratic nominee is coming off one of the toughest weeks of her campaign, forced to the sidelines for three days to recover from pneumonia.

""What matters is who registers to vote, and who is motivated and mobilized to turn out to vote,"" she told reporters. ""And I'm going to keep doing everything I can to deliver my message about what's at stake in this election.""

One of the most striking takeaways from the poll findings this week is that even with all of Trump's controversies and polarizing comments, Clinton is still struggling to stitch together key parts of the Obama coalition. That point was particularly evident in the new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist state polls this week that showed her with softer support from Latinos and young voters than Obama.

""This (election) really, in some ways, is coming down to young voters,"" said Della Volpe. ""She has not yet solidified what arguably should be one of the core constituencies of any Democratic campaign.""

""When I hear folks saying they're not inspired in this election, I disagree,"" Obama said. ""I am inspired because for eight years, I have had the privilege to see what it takes to do this job and here's what I know for sure. ... Right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president.""

Clinton and her allies brushed off the week's new numbers as an expected development in what the Democratic candidate said was always going to be ""a tight race.""

Joel Benenson, Clinton's chief strategist, told CNN's Erin Burnett in an interview Thursday that the campaign was still ""playing for 270 electoral votes.""

""We are still playing more offense in states around the country and keeping the Trump campaign on defense, particularly in states that are must-wins for them like Virginia and North Carolina,"" Benenson said. ""They're not making us play defense anywhere.""

""What's happened as much as anything else is that the election is taking on the contours of the 2012 election to a very large extent,"" said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. ""The ups and downs in the race have depended on the degree to which (Mitt) Romney voters from 2012 considered Trump to be acceptable or beyond the fringe. ... Right now, what we are seeing in the polls is that more Romney voters are willing to go with Trump.""

Garin, an adviser to the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action, suggested that, in the long run, there could be an advantage to Trump's calmer demeanor for his Democratic opponent.

""When Donald Trump is not behaving, he's sort of like a car crash that people can't help but stop and look at,"" Garin said. ""If Trump is being less outrageous and less titillating, it means that Hillary Clinton has a better chance to get her own message through and have the election litigated on her own terms.""

In a reflective speech Thursday, Clinton said her few days off the trail helped clarify what the 2016 campaign is about. Contrasting her style and tone with her rival's, she once again called Trump ""a loose cannon"" who would put America's gains at risk. Charting her course for the next few weeks, she said she would focus on working families and the challenges facing young people. In a nod to her vulnerabilities, she also acknowledged some of the criticisms of her public persona.

""I have been involved in politics one way or another for many years. It is not an easy business. It can get rough and I have built up some defenses,"" she said. ""When it comes to public service, I am better at the service part than the public part.""

But she said she was not ""the showman"" that her opponent is and promised to ""deliver for you and your family,"" which will be one of the cornerstones of her message in the final stretch of the campaign.

The closeness of the polls clearly could mean more difficult races for down-ballot Democratic Senate and House candidates who are hoping Clinton's candidacy, and her well-organized operation, will give them a lift at the polls.

In New Hampshire this week, for example, Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte opened an 8-point lead over Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan: 52% to 44% among likely voters in a new NBC/WSJ/Marist poll after earlier polls had showed a much closer race.

As voters are paying more attention to the race, University of New Hampshire Survey Center Director Andy Smith said Clinton's vulnerabilities are coming into sharper focus and that is having a drag on the ticket. So much attention has been focused on Trump throughout the campaign, he said, that people paid less attention to how unpopular Clinton was.

""The candidate who has coattails is the candidate who is going to be able to pull in voters who might not otherwise have voted -- and that's what Obama was able to do in 2008 and 2012, especially among younger voters, African-American voters and minority voters,"" Smith said.

But this year, many of those young voters in New Hampshire voted for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary, Smith noted.

""Obama was able to pull them out in 2008, and to a lesser extent in 2012, and they voted for Democrats down the ticket, but they're much less likely to vote this time around with Clinton at the top of the ticket,"" he said.

Some Democrats expect the Obama coalition to coalesce as Election Day draws closer.

""There is clearly a gap for Clinton with younger voters that her campaign will pay attention to,"" said Bill Burton, a former adviser to Obama. ""But once younger voters realize that anything but a vote for Clinton is a vote for Trump, the numbers will settle and the artificially high Gary Johnson numbers will come back to earth ... The Obama coalition is lagging in getting behind Clinton, but the debates will help natural gravity set in and bring this race where it will end.""

Other Democrats see a bright side to a closer race at the top of the ticket in the sense that it could propel more voters to get out to the polls. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that if Republicans want to believe that this race is tightening, ""let them believe that.""

""Because the more our own people see that it's important to vote, and a tight race sort of speaks to that urgency, then more of them will turn out. So it works to our advantage,"" Pelosi said.",0
2545,That Cute Whale You Clicked On? It’s Doomed - The New York Times,"I was scrolling through Instagram when I saw it: a white fuzz ball of a baby seal, snuggling in a snowdrift. I stared dopily into its clear black eyes, squealed at the screen and tapped the cartoon heart beneath the photo. You better believe I liked it. Then I read the caption. “A newborn harp seal hides behind a piece of sea ice and seeks shelter during a blizzard,” it said. Aww. It went on: “With   climate and the loss of sea ice, harp seals are losing their birthing grounds. ” Oh. “In 2007,” it added, “more than 70 percent of the pups died due to poor ice conditions. In 2010, almost none survived. As I type this, baby harp seals are struggling to survive yet another terrible ice year near the Magdalen Islands. ” Oh, God. I came to Instagram to get a quick baby animal fix and left with a horrifying message about how climate change could wipe this pup from the face of the planet, and all of its little friends, too. Paul Nicklen, the wildlife photographer who took the image, knows what he’s doing. “I hang a cute animal picture out there like bait and reel them in,” he told me. I’m hooked. Intellectually, I understand that climate change is one of the most important issues facing our planet. But practically, I ignore it. The problem feels too big, and the science too boring. I’ve never found a convenient time to watch “An Inconvenient Truth. ” I haven’t paged through a copy of National Geographic in my adult life. I’m part of the problem. But now, a crew of wildlife photographers and conservationists has found a way to reach me through one of social media’s shallowest pleasures: ogling marine mammals on Instagram. “Climate change is so huge, so uncomfortable, and so overwhelming, it’s hard to talk about it,” Mr. Nicklen said. “And often the best scientists are the worst communicators. ” Mr. Nicklen, a marine biologist as well as a photographer, is not personally drawn to the cutesy stuff. But after posting a picture two years ago of a   baby Emperor penguin that inspired an avalanche of “likes,” he’s come around to the advantages of the aesthetic. He regularly draws in his 2. 6 million followers with heartwarming images, then pairs them with captions that recast them as cautionary tales. Every so often, he’ll post a direct glimpse of impending doom: a sea otter wheezing its last breaths on an Alaskan beach, or the body of a young polar bear that starved to death in an area of the Arctic that has lost its ice. Following wildlife Instagram means experiencing emotional whiplash. The savviest photographers work to achieve a careful balance between the superficial and the political. Jasper Doest, a Dutch wildlife photographer and conservationist, recently took a series of haunting photographs of white storks that had made their homes on European landfills. “I could fill up my whole Instagram with very harsh images of storks laying there dead in the garbage and feeding on plastic, but people would eventually have enough of that,” Mr. Doest said. He takes care to insert idyllic images amid the uncomfortable ones. “The first thing you want is for the audience to fall in love with the subject,” he said. Only then do you show that subject living on human garbage. Keeping the Instagram audience clicking into a wildlife photographer’s feed means serving up different kinds of images from those that appear in National Geographic. One of Brian Skerry’s most celebrated photographs shows a dead thresher shark caught in a fishing net off the Mexican coast National Geographic has named it one of the magazine’s 50 greatest photographs of all time. But when Mr. Skerry, a longtime National Geographic photojournalist, shared it with his 465, 000 Instagram followers, it was met with a muted response. More popular than the shark are the images Mr. Skerry took of a spinner dolphin leaping beneath a rainbow, a baby beluga whale seemingly smiling coyly for the camera, and a seal posing coolly underwater with one flipper folded over the other. The seal looks as if it were “about to drop his mixtape,” as one commenter put it. These casual internet surfers might be tempted to scroll past conservation public service announcements (preachy) or scientific tracts (boring). But Instagram’s freewheeling platform has opened a trap door into environmental awareness. When Mr. Skerry posted a   portrait of a baby seal, he tagged it with the terms #climatechange and #nature, but also #seals, #babyanimals and #love. The Instagram users lured in by a magnetic animal photo may find themselves unexpectedly open to the   message. “It can make them feel like they’re making these discoveries on their own,” Mr. Nicklen said. And while Instagram lacks the   safeguards of more traditional scientific sources, it engenders a sincere, authentic experience. “Because of the intimate nature of these posts, viewers come to trust the photographers,” said Joel Sartore, a National Geographic photographer who has dedicated his career (and his Instagram) to photographing rare animals. “They feel that they know them. ” The comments in wildlife photographers’ feeds have spontaneously turned into de facto public forums on   science. Under a recent photograph of a polar bear that died of starvation, posted by Mr. Nicklen, an argument unfurled among sentimental animal lovers (“Can the governments do something? Drop fish, meat, anything to give these animals strength? ”) radical vegans (it’s “meat and dairy eaters   …     Who claim to be animal lovers . .. Who are contributing to this”) and climate change deniers (“You people do realize that we are coming out of an ice age. ”) Last year, Mr. Nicklen and the photographer Cristina Mittermeier began SeaLegacy, a nonprofit that “bridges the gap between information and emotion” by pairing photographers with activist organizations. Instagram’s conservationists are hoping their images will inspire fans to do more than just look. That will test the limits of human nature, not to mention the constraints of the platform. Instagram is built for passing out eye candy. The captions are afterthoughts. When I scroll through my feed, it feels so good to tap and share an image that I don’t even think to feel bad for skipping over some critical context. Animals may be dying in the Arctic, but on Instagram, I can always find a newborn seal pup to share. The pictures are so freaking cute  —   who among us is strong enough to stop staring at the phone and start taking action?",0
1949,Mediaset and Vivendi in contact over pay-TV dispute: source,"FILE PHOTO: A woman walks walk past the main entrance of the entertainment-to-telecoms conglomerate Vivendi's headquarters in Paris, France, April 8, 2015. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo
MILAN (Reuters) - Italian broadcaster Mediaset and French media group Vivendi (VIV.PA) have opened lines of communication to find a solution to a bitter legal dispute, a source close to the matter said on Monday, as shares in the Italian company rose sharply.
The two companies have been at loggerheads since Vivendi backtracked last year on a deal to buy Mediaset’s (MS.MI) pay-TV unit Premium.
The rift deepened when Vivendi built up a 28.8 percent stake in Mediaset last December in a move which the French group said was not hostile but a sign of long-term interest.
Mediaset is 39.5 percent owned by the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. It is suing Vivendi for damages of at least 3 billion euros.
An Italian source close to the matter said on Monday lawyers representing Mediaset and Vivendi were holding talks, but added it would be difficult to reach an agreement.
On Saturday Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore said the two sides were negotiating for a possible solution ahead of a court hearing scheduled for Dec. 19.
The paper said a planned joint-venture between Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) and Vivendi’s pay-TV arm Canal + could be extended to Mediaset as part of any potential deal.
Milan-based broker Banca Akros said in a note on Monday a possible broader partnership involving Vivendi and Telecom Italia would be a very positive development.
“... a wider industrial partnership with Vivendi-Telecom Italia would offer more value creation for Mediaset than the deep downsizing of Premium announced last January,” it said.
Mediaset’s share price ended the session up 8.3 percent at 3.144 euros, while Vivendi’s shares were up 0.6 percent at 21.28 euros.",0
41420,Sweet home Chicago: Obama re-emerges in city where it all began,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday makes his first major appearance since leaving office, having chosen Chicago, the city where his political career started, to emerge from a three-month hiatus from the public eye. Obama will meet youth leaders and promote community organizing near the same South Side neighborhoods where his own activism blossomed and propelled him to two terms in the White House that ended with Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20.  Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served as Obama’s first White House chief of staff, said that he was proud that Obama picked Chicago to make his last speech as president and the first in his post-presidency. “I think it reflects his emotional, as well as his intellectual, commitment to this city and seeing this city as his home,” he said. Obama’s continued connection to Chicago is important to the city, which has global aspirations as well as a palpable insecurity about its place in the world. During the last year of Obama’s second term, Chicago laid claim to its share of his legacy by beating out Hawaii and New York as the site of his presidential library.  Obama, who still owns a home in Chicago, was raised in Hawaii. The former president and his wife Michelle are expected to move from Washington to New York once their younger daughter, Sasha, graduates from high school. David Axelrod, a former top political adviser to Obama, said the decision to house the library in Chicago should have eased any concerns that its residents may have had about the former Democratic president’s commitment to the city.  But Monday’s event, he said, is another important sign of the former president’s strong links to Chicago. “He’s going to be more visible moving forward,” he said. “I think this is clearly a coming-out.” Reverend Michael Pfleger, a social justice activist who heads a large South Side Roman Catholic church, said a prominent Obama presence could help the nation’s third-largest city confront some of the thorny problems it faces.  Chief among them is a spike in gun violence, an issue that  Trump has highlighted as a sign of lawlessness and the failure of the Democratic politicians who have long run Chicago. “It’s his life, and he’s not in elected office right now, so he can do what he wants,” Pfleger said. “But I’d love to see him engage in his home of Chicago. He could make a huge difference.” Civil Rights activist Jesse Jackson said Obama could use his powerful platform to address stark inequalities in Chicago schools, housing and employment, and to advocate for reinvestment in blighted neighborhoods. Monday’s event takes place on the South Side campus of the University of Chicago, where Obama once taught constitutional law. It is intended “to encourage and support the next generation of leaders driven by strengthening communities,” according to a statement. Since leaving office, Obama has kept a relatively low public profile, taking vacations in Palm Springs, California and the British Virgin Islands, where he indulged in the sport of kite-boarding while vacationing with British billionaire Sir Richard Branson.  Together with his wife, who grew up on Chicago’s South Side, the former president recently struck a two-book, $65 million memoir deal. He is expected to travel to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel next month. ",0

21671, GOP Rep Gets RIPPED APART After Saying Sean Spicer Was Right About Hitler,"On Wednesday, GOP Rep. Kevin Cramer opened his mouth and inserted his foot so deep that the nation s top doctors will still be trying to remove it when he inevitably loses his next election in a landslide. According to Cramer, Sean Spicer was kinda right when he presented some  alternative facts  regarding the Holocaust   specifically, his claim that Adolf Hitler didn t use chemical weapons (not even in concentration camps or, as Spicer calls them,  Holocaust centers. The media is so gullible, they fall for these things because they think it s really hot stuff and the public just can t wait to stick it to Sean Spicer   who 99% of the people wouldn t have the foggiest idea who he is and it distracts them from other things,  Cramer told conservative radio North Dakota radio host Scott Hennen.  I can t even believe that anybody in the media, much less all of the major networks, led with this story. A spokesperson, who by the way made a poor illustration, but it s not completely, it s not without some validity. I think he apologized and that s the end of it, Cramer said, as though denying the Holocaust can be fixed with a fauxpology.  I think what he was saying is that Hitler didn t take chemical weapons out in a battle-like form and do what Assad did with these children. It s a factual statement,  Cramer says.What Spicer actually said was that Adolf Hitler didn t use chemical weapons, which makes him better than Assad: We didn t use chemical weapons in World War II. You had a, someone who is as despicable as Hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons. He later explained that he acknowledges that Hitler took Jewish people to  Holocaust centers  but that Hitler was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing. How are people responding to this? Well, let s just say that the  Sean Spicer was right that Hitler was a good dude compared to Assad  strategy isn t working out for him:North Dakota Rep.

15214,China: Trump Victory Shows ’Fragility of Western Democracy’ - Breitbart,"Chinese state publications are using leftist protests over the weekend to argue that President Donald Trump has a fragile mandate to govern, and that this proves that free societies are weaker ones than communist dictatorships like that of China. [This according to an opinion article in the Global Times, often China’s most belligerent   newspaper. “From the protests against Trump, Chinese people found the schism in the US is becoming increasingly serious and are questioning the reliability and universality of the Western democratic system,” the column argues, citing Chinese social media users as its source. The column also quotes Chinese professor Chu Yin, who says, “many Americans don’t accept ‘procedural justice’ any more just because   and liberals have decided that Trump’s victory is the death of democracy. ”  “Some Chinese analysts believe the widespread protests show the fragility of Western democracy,” the column claims. The Global Times published another commentary claiming the United States is currently embroiled in total chaos. ” The U. S. is not a united country now, and the authority of its current leadership is not guaranteed,” the article claims, adding that Trump “has a lot of ‘enemies’ within, and he is also making ‘enemies’ across the world. ” Bloomberg notes that the     newspaper People’s Daily is also promoting the idea that free societies are on the brink of collapse due to President Trump’s inauguration. “Western style democracy used to be a recognized power in history to drive social development. But now it has reached its limits,” a People’s Daily article reads. “Democracy is already kidnapped by the capitals and has become the weapon for capitalists to chase profits. ” The newspaper reportedly “devoted an entire page on Sunday to critiquing Western democracies  …     saying the ultimate defeat of capitalism would enable Communism to emerge victorious. ” While the propaganda newspapers have begun to use Trump to galvanize support for the Communist Party, Beijing itself has continued to approach Trump with polite concern. Rather than making any generalizations about the meaning of Trump’s victory on a largely   platform, the Chinese Foreign Ministry has repeatedly demanded that Trump respect Communist Party demands, such as their illegal claim to most of the South China Sea and the continued lack of recognition of Taiwan’s sovereignty. “We urge the new administration to fully understand the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue and to continue pursuing the one China policy,” Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday, following up on comments before the inauguration that sounded little like the combative pieces in official state media. On Friday, asked about Trump’s upcoming inauguration, Hua said: We would like to join hands with the new US administration to uphold the principles of     mutual respect and   cooperation, deepen communication and dialogue, build up mutual trust, respect and accommodate each other’s core interests and major concerns, properly deal with sensitive issues and disputes in constructive ways, expand bilateral cooperation on bilateral, regional and global issues across the board, and propel further development of   ties at a new staring point. Trump has repeatedly stated that he does not think that the “One China” policy, which demands other nations ignore Taiwan’s sovereignty, should remain in effect unquestioned. He has also engaged in    communications with Taiwanese President Tsai   breaking   precedent and infuriating China. While the Foreign Ministry has kept its tone civil, however, Chinese state media has not. In contrast to Hua, the   China Daily published a story warning that Beijing will “take the gloves off” with Trump should he continue to entertain the idea of ending “One China. ”",0
15,"In Major League Soccer, Argentines Find a Home and Success - The New York Times","Guillermo Barros Schelotto was not the first Argentine player to set foot on a Major League Soccer field. Statistically speaking, he was the 28th when he made his debut for the Columbus Crew in 2007. But Schelotto’s phone still rings to this day, more than six years after he left the league, with calls from fellow Argentines looking for advice. Though Schelotto, 43, is currently the coach of Boca Juniors, the most decorated team in Argentina, most of the players who call him want to talk about other teams, about other countries, about a soccer world away from the   environment of Buenos Aires. “Most of them like to talk about the cities,” Schelotto said. Many of them find a way to come. Argentines now make up the   demographic in M. L. S. trailing only Americans. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, going into this season’s openers, 98 Argentine players had been featured in an M. L. S.   game since the league’s inception. Sebastian Blanco, a new designated player for Portland, made his debut in an opener Friday and became No. 99. In a ranking by nationality, Argentines have the   goal total, too. Twelve of the 22 teams in M. L. S. will start the season with at least one Argentine on their roster, a list that includes stars like Dallas’s Mauro Diaz and Montreal’s Ignacio Piatti and newcomers like Atlanta’s Hector Villalba and New York City F. C.’s Maxi Moralez. Why do they come? For some it’s the money, or at least the promise that it will be paid regularly. Others come for the lifestyle, the chance to fade into a comparative anonymity unavailable to them at home, or to live the “quiet, clean” life that Schelotto describes as he reminisces about his days in Ohio. The Portland Timbers playmaker Diego Valeri was one such player who called Schelotto, his former manager, and he eventually heeded his advice. But he said it was for an entirely different reason. A year before he signed with Portland, while under contract to his hometown club Lanus, Valeri had had a gun pressed to his throat when robbers attempted to steal his BMW with his wife, Florencia, and daughter, Connie, inside. “After that moment,” Valeri said with considerable understatement, “we thought about opportunities to play outside and know different places in the world. ” Within a year, Valeri, who had had loan spells in Portugal and Spain, was on his way to Portland. “Situations like that are very hard for the Argentinian people to change,” he said. The    Valeri and his family are now settled in the Northwest, where he is playing arguably the best soccer of his career. He is a     and in between was named the most valuable player when Portland won the 2015 M. L. S. Cup championship game. “I think they like the anonymity and the tranquillity here,” Caleb Porter, Valeri’s coach with the Timbers, said of his star and his countrymen. “They really relish the opportunity to be here and to live a lifestyle that’s different to how they lived in Argentina. They transition well into M. L. S. ” Since 2011, Portland has signed six Argentines, including its   acquisition of Blanco, 28. Valeri has been a good ambassador  —   he speaks English and urges newcomers to try to learn it as soon as possible, to ease the transition. But Porter and the Timbers’ general manager and president of soccer, Gavin Wilkinson, believe there is another, more straightforward reason for Argentina’s outsize presence in M. L. S.: It simply produces the kind of technical player that the league desires. “Certain countries produce certain positions more,” Porter said. “Most teams are looking for that creative piece, and you know you can get one in Argentina. ” A large alumni directory and strong ties to agents and consultants in the region have made that kind of shopping easier for M. L. S. teams, and in the past the struggles of the Argentine economy also favored North American clubs, some said. But there also has been a change in the kind of individual looking to make the move north, and that has dovetailed with the league’s overall transfer policy. As the quality of M. L. S. has improved as it enters its third decade, its teams have looked less for marketability from its imports  —   which in the past had trended toward aging, often European stars  —   and more toward onfield impact and value. The latest class of Argentines reflects this shift, as they enter a league where the average age of designated players  —   the team’s   stars  —   has fallen below 28, its lowest point in a decade. “They know that M. L. S. is different to 10 years ago,” said Schelotto, who was 34 when he moved to the league. “They can go, make good money, play with some pressure. They know they can make a career in the United States and then maybe move to Europe. “Ten years ago, it was impossible. Right now, you can. ” There are currently 24 Argentines playing in the league. Atlanta United and its Argentine coach, Tata Martino, brought in three ahead of its first season, each of them 25 or younger (Villalba is just 22). Buying young is now seen as more of a benefit to clubs than a risk, as players who continue to develop retain a   value if they move on to brighter prospects in Europe. “People are coming here younger and younger, maybe to start their careers,” Ignacio Piatti, a    playmaker for the Montreal Impact, said through an interpreter. “It’s what they are looking for at that age: being able to live a comfortable life off the field and focus on their games. ” Piatti, like Schelotto, has been happy to offer advice to the next wave of Argentine talents considering entering M. L. S. including players on both sides of the Hudson River. Gonzalo Veron, 27, of the Red Bulls, and Moralez, 30, who recently signed with New York City F. C. both acknowledged that they had turned to Piatti for advice before signing. At a community event in East Harlem last week, Moralez  —   who spent four years in Italy  —   reflected on his decision to move to the United States. He had never been to New York City before signing, he said, and after turning to the likes of Piatti and David Villa for advice about the league’s standard of play, he said he also sought assurances for his family, who are set to join him in New York shortly. “First off, I just want to enjoy football,” Moralez said. “But also to get to know the beauty of the city and the country. Not everybody gets the opportunity to come here. ”",0
35109,"WATCH: ANGRY PARENTS WALK OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL’S RACIST, ANTI-COP COMMENCEMENT SPEECH [Video]","Another leftist educator uses the precious time they ve been given to deliver an inspirational speech to high school graduates to instead, deliver a radical, divisive and hateful message. A Missouri high school principal sent some parents toward the exits last week when he made a disparaging remark about police  killing young black men  during a graduation speech.Belton High School Principal Fred Skretta was talking about why he became a teacher when he suddenly veered off in an unexpected direction. I wanted to be a teacher because I wanted to change the world, I wanted to make it a better place,  he told the audience.  I m going to be honest with you, in a lot of ways I fear that we are not there yet. If we were there, we wouldn t have conflicts between police killing young black men. https://youtu.be/mQHKFGBPREUNever mind the poor sentence structure. Some parents were so offended by the commentary they got up and walked out of the ceremony, according to Fox 4 News. I found it very inappropriate, I am highly offended,  a parent said.  You don t use the platform of a child s graduation to push a political agenda or push your personal opinions.  Your job is supposed to inspire, educate, inform and not indoctronize one way or the other. Interestingly, Fox4News reported that Skretta posted an apology on social media after the ceremony, but the Twitter account appears to have been deleted since then.The apology, according to the Fox affiliate: TY all at #BHS graduation! I apologize if my remarks were offensive. Our law enforcement have difficult jobs & I meant no disrespect #agape  Doc Skretta (@Principal_BHS) May 17, 2015 Belton district deputy superintendent, Steve Morgan, later offered an apology also, Fox4News reported. Comments were made at graduation and they certainly are not reflective of the district, so we sent out an apology in a statement today that went to all patrons reflecting that,  Morgan said.Via: BizPac Review",1
13247,The negative health effects of fragranced products,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 21:38 UTC One of the academic professionals in my vast network includes Anne Steinemann, Professor of Civil Engineering, Chair of Sustainable Cities, Melbourne School of Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Australia, who just published the research paper, Fragranced consumer products: exposures and effects from emissions , October 7, 2016. Dr Steinemann was kind enough to email a copy of her exciting work, which I'd like to bring to consumers' attention since gas out fumes from fragranced products definitely have negative impacts upon human health. Back in the 1970s, I tried bringing attention to gas out from formaldehyde fumes that were saturating everything from carpeting to fabric stores, with fragrances in almost anything from toilet tissue to you name it—scented candles being the most offensive. How employees worked in those stores that took away one's breath, was totally incomprehensible to me. Didn't they know those fumes were not friendly to their nasal sinuses, throat, bronchi and lungs? Professor Steinemann's article needs to be studied seriously, especially by parents with young children who are more prone to developing respiratory problems and allergies. Probably two of the more offensive gas-off consumer products are cologne and perfume, which women over-use plus men's after shave. Both affect young children who are carried close to their parents' bodies and must breathe in those irritating fumes. Please consider that those scents can cause respiratory problems for baby. Comment: Hidden Chemicals in Perfume and Cologne The average fragrance product tested contained 14 secret chemicals not listed on the label. Among them are chemicals associated with hormone disruption and allergic reactions, and many substances that have not been assessed for safety in personal care products. Also in the ranks of undisclosed ingredients are chemicals with troubling hazardous properties or with a propensity to accumulate in human tissues. These include diethyl phthalate, a chemical found in 97 percent of Americans (Silva 2004) and linked to sperm damage in human epidemiological studies (Swan 2008), and musk ketone, a synthetic fragrance ingredient that concentrates in human fat tissue and breast milk (Hutter 2009; Reiner 2007). The above article Abstract states, Results from this study provide strong evidence that fragranced products can trigger adverse health effects in the general population. The study also indicates that reducing exposure to fragranced products, such as through fragrance-free policies, can provide cost-effective and relatively simple ways to reduce risks and improve air quality and health. Furthermore, I'd like to call readers' attention to the statistics cited regarding HEALTH EFFECTS. Here's what Professor Steinemann's research confirmed: Overall, 34.7 % of the population reported one or more types of adverse health effects from exposure to one or more types of fragranced products. The most common types of adverse effects were as follows: 18.6 % respiratory problems; 16.2 % mucosal symptoms; 15.7 % migraine headaches; 10.6 % skin problems; 8.0%asthma attacks; 7.2%neurological problems; 5.8 % cognitive problems; 5.5 % gastrointestinal problems; 4.4 % cardiovascular problems; 4.0 % immune system problems; 3.8 % musculoskeletal problems; and 1.7 % other. Personally, I think the above stats could meet the 'criteria' for those affected and who experience what's called ""Multiple Chemical Sensitivities"" (MCS), a condition exacerbated by environmental pollutants, e.g., smog, chemtrails, odors, chemical gas out fumes, and fragrances, relieved only by total avoidance and undertaking a supervised detoxification program, in my opinion. Because of the ""super-saturation aggregate"" of chemicals in air, food, water and environment, the human immune system is being compromised constantly, whether we know it or not. Therefore, it ought to be incumbent upon everyone, I think, to avoid any chemical gas out fumes like scented candles, dryer sheets, cleaning products, automobile and room air fresheners, scented personal beauty products, e.g., soaps, lotions, perfumes, after shave, hair sprays, etc. Let's not ignore ""flame retardants."" In my opinion, one of the most irritating scents is found in room air freshener products, which are caustic to mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, throat and bronchi. Many public restrooms gas out deodorizing chemicals toxic fumes, which ought to be outlawed, in my opinion, as people are forced to breathe them in order to use public restrooms. Complain to managers in stores, theaters and other public places when you encounter such chemical assaults on your lungs. Laundry products leave scents in bed linens that infants, toddlers and adults must sleep on seven or more hours a day, which is not conducive to a healthy respiratory system and weakens the immune system, in my opinion. Toxic chemical fume exposure is a stress on the body! Have pity on your poor liver, the main detoxifying organ in the body, and give it a chance to recoup as much as possible. Wearing perfumes and breathing in room air fresheners are constant chemical stresses to the body. However, one of the most egregious out gassing of toxic scents is found in all new clothing. The odor smells like perfume, but contains many chemicals to keep the fabric 'sized'. I can smell someone wearing new clothing several feet away from me. If I can smell it, I question whether it's harming the person wearing it, as most people don't realize what's going on with new clothing. I heartily suggest laundering every new piece of clothing before wearing it or putting it on a baby or toddler—especially! If there's something that can't be laundered, place it in a clothes dryer on a high heat setting for as long as it takes to 'cook off' the fumes. I discuss a lot about chemical reactions in my 2009 book, Our Chemical Lives And The Hijacking Of Our DNA, A Probe Into What's Probably Making Us Sick. Personally, I don't buy anything that cannot be laundered before wearing! Sometimes I 'cook' new clothing in my dryer for several hours before it's gassed out. Wetting two clean wash clothes that are wrung out as dry as possible and placed into the dryer with new clothing, I found, helps the gas out go faster and reduces dryer time. Would you like to know what some of those sizing chemicals are? According to our friends at Organic Consumers Association, Chemicals often used for finishing include formaldehyde , caustic soda, sulfuric acid, bromines, urea resins, sulfonamides, halogens, and bromines. Some imported clothes are now impregnated with long-lasting disinfectants which are very hard to remove, and whose smell gives them away. [1] Professor Steinemann found that Fragranced product manufacturers are not required to disclose all ingredients in their formulations. This lack of disclosure can impede efforts to understand and reduce adverse effects associated with potentially harmful compounds, such as certain volatile organic compounds and semi-volatile organic compounds. Further, we lack knowledge on which specific chemicals or mixtures of chemicals are associated with the adverse effects, and this is an important area for research. In my opinion, there ought to be a law prohibiting any non-disclosure policies of all ingredients used in business and industry manufacturing! Where are FDA, EPA and OSHA regulations regarding those loopholes in manufacturing and merchandising? I mention OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) because the workplace can be very problematic for many reasons: chemical gas out fumes from carpeting and other construction materials; perfumes, which can be compared to tobacco smoking fumes; and unrealized particulates given off from heat production by electronic equipment—often the source of eye irritation, I think. Indoor air pollution can originate from many sources. Thanks, Professor Steinemann, for your timely and exceptional study. Fragranced consumer products: exposures and effects from emissions",1
44061,Conflict over Russia is rocky start for Trump and intelligence agencies,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump’s rejection this weekend of U.S. intelligence analysts’ conclusion that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help him win the White House is the latest in a string of conflicts between Trump and the intelligence community he will command. Most of them involve Russia, which has grown increasingly aggressive - according to what U.S. intelligence agencies have told Congress and the administration of President Barack Obama - in Syria and Ukraine. The agencies also reported that Russia has ratcheted up activities in cyberspace including meddling, sometimes covertly, in European and U.S. elections. The intelligence agencies have concluded with “high confidence” that not only did their Russian counterparts direct the hacking of Democratic Party organizations and leaders, but they did so to undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, not just to shake confidence in the U.S. electoral system, a senior U.S. official said on Friday.      The president-elect’s transition office responded by releasing a statement that exaggerated his margin of victory and attacked the U.S. intelligence community’s work on Iraq, but did not address the analysts’ conclusion about Russia. “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction,” the statement said. “The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It’s now time to move on and ‘Make America Great Again.’”  In a statement issued on Saturday, California Democrat Adam Schiff, a member of the House intelligence committee, called the Russian hacking of the U.S. election “spectacularly successful.” “One would also have to be willfully blind not to see that these Russian actions were uniformly damaging to Secretary (of State Hillary) Clinton and helpful to Donald Trump,” Schiff said. “I do not believe this was coincidental or unintended.” Trump has rejected the intelligence agencies’ finding. “I don’t believe they interfered,” he told Time magazine about Russia in an interview published this week. “That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say, ‘Oh, Russia interfered.’” Russian officials have denied all accusations of interference in the U.S. election. The president-elect has been receiving the President’s Daily Brief (PDB), one of the most highly classified documents in the U.S. government and which can include details of U.S. and allied covert operations, only once a week. That is far less often than most of his predecessors.So far, intelligence officials said, Trump has not requested a special briefing on Russia, despite the agencies’ warnings that Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to undermine trans-Atlantic unity and test U.S. and allied resolve. In fact, two officials with knowledge of the situation said on Saturday that Trump’s transition team has made only “incidental contact” with the Central Intelligence Agency. This is despite the fact that Trump’s choice to head the CIA, U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, has limited experience working with the agency. The Kansas Republican served on the House Intelligence Committee and the select committee investigating the 2012 attack on U.S. diplomatic and intelligence facilities in Benghazi, Libya. Democrats and some Republicans in Congress who have been briefed on the Russian activities share the intelligence agencies’ alarm about Trump’s plans for the 17-agency intelligence community, which includes the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Counterterrorism Center. Privately, some members of the clandestine service, the CIA’s body of spies, said they would resign rather than obey any order to resume waterboarding or other “enhanced interrogation techniques” that Trump endorsed during his campaign.Elsewhere in the $70 billion-a-year intelligence community officials on Saturday said they fear that Trump might invite legal trouble by trying to vastly expand electronic and physical surveillance of suspected terrorists based on their religion or national origin. None of that may come to pass, of course, and campaign rhetoric and tweets do not always predict policies, the officials conceded.However, Trump’s statements about Russia and business dealings there, as well as those of retired Army Lieutenant Michael Flynn, his choice for national security adviser, are  worrisome to many of the officials tracking Putin’s growing aggressiveness from seas to skies to cyberspace. Obama has ordered the intelligence agencies to review cyber attacks and foreign intervention into the 2016 election and deliver a report before he leaves office on Jan. 20, the White House said on Friday. Obama’s homeland security adviser, Lisa Monaco, told reporters on Friday the report’s results would be shared with lawmakers and others. “The president has directed the intelligence community to conduct a full review of what happened during the 2016 election process ... and to capture lessons learned from that and to report to a range of stakeholders, to include the Congress,” she said during an event hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.

7841,Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence,"Get Ready For Civil Unrest: Survey Finds That Most Americans Are Concerned About Election Violence Time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it Michael Snyder | Economic Collapse - October 27, 2016 Comments 
Could we see violence no matter who wins on November 8th? Let’s hope that it doesn’t happen, but as you will see below, anti-Trump violence is already sweeping the nation. 
If Trump were to actually win the election, that would likely send the radical left into a violent post-election temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before. Alternatively, there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by Hillary Clinton. And as I showed yesterday, it appears that voting machines in Texas are already switching votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton . If Hillary Clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances, that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country. 
At this moment there is less than two weeks to go until November 8th, and a brand new survey has found that a majority of Americans are concerned “about the possibility of violence” on election day… 
A 51% majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on Election Day; one in five are “very concerned.” Three of four say they have confidence that the United States will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked American democracy for more than 200 years, but just 40% say they are “very confident” about that. 
More than four in 10 of Trump supporters say they won’t recognize the legitimacy of Clinton as president, if she prevails, because they say she wouldn’t have won fair and square. 
But many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence. On Wednesday, Donald Trump’s star on the Walk of Fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pick-ax… 
Donald Trump took a lot of hits today, and not just in the Presidential race. With less than two weeks to go before America decides if the ex- Apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pick-ax in what looks to be a Tinseltown first. 
And there were two other instances earlier this year when Donald Trump’s star was also vandalized. One came in January, and the other happened in June … 
This is of course not the first time the GOP candidate’s star has been attacked or defaced since Trump announced his White House bid in summer 2015. The most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at 6801 Hollywood Blvd in late January. In June this summer, a mute sign was painted on Trump’s star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused Trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign. In both cases, Trump’s star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day. 
We have seen anti-Trump violence on the east coast as well. Earlier this month, someone decided to firebomb the Republican Party headquarters in Orange County, North Carolina. On the building next to the headquarters, someone spray-painted “Nazi Republicans get out of town or else” along with a swastika. 
There have also been other disturbing incidents of anti-Trump violence all over the nation in recent days. A recent Lifezette article put together quite a long list, and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece… 
On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, “Why can’t they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement?” 
Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. “The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by ‘some thugs’ that a barmaid called out from the back.” Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a “Blue Lives Matter” shirt. 
On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. 
There is a move to get Trump supporters to wear red on election day, but in many parts of America that might just turn his supporters into easy targets. Let’s certainly hope that we don’t see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating. 
Of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad, and a Hillary Clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge. 
For example, this week former Congressman Joe Walsh said that he is “grabbing my musket” if Donald Trump loses the election… 
Former Rep. Joe Walsh appeared to call for armed revolution Wednesday if Donald Trump is not elected president. 
Walsh, a former tea party congressman from Illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host, tweeted, “On November 8th, I’m voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I’m grabbing my musket. You in?” 
And without a doubt, many ordinary Americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case Hillary Clinton is victorious. The following comes from USA Today … 
“Since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards Hillary Clinton, I’ve been buying a lot more ammunition,” says Rick Darling, 69, an engineer from Harrison Township, in Michigan’s Detroit suburbs. In a follow-up phone interview after being surveyed, the Trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to “declare martial law and take our guns away” after the election. 
Today America is more divided than I have ever seen it before, and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another. 
Ironically, Donald Trump has been working very hard to bring America together. In fact, he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any Republican presidential candidate since 1960 . 
If Hillary Clinton and the Democrats win on November 8th, things will not go well for Hillary Clinton’s political enemies. The Clintons used the power of the White House to go after their enemies the first time around, and Hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then. 
And the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are. This is something that I discussed on national television earlier this month … 
As I write this, it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a Hillary Clinton presidency would be. 
But at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome . 
Out of all the candidates that we could have chosen, the American people are about to put the most evil one by far into the White House. 
Perhaps Donald Trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate, but time is rapidly slipping away and November 8th will be here before we know it. NEWSLETTER SIGN UP  ",1
18889,Se reencuentran dos gemeliers separados al nacer,"Se reencuentran dos gemeliers separados al nacer LOS EXPERTOS CONFIRMAN QUE SON EJEMPLARES DE LA MISMA CAMADA reencuentro 
Dos gemeliers separados al nacer se han reencontrado hoy tras 18 años sobreviviendo en solitario. Los dos especímenes fueron hallados canturreando en libertad por diferentes puntos de la geografía española. Tras ser capturados por las autoridades forestales en la localidad de Aljarafe, y después de ser observados detenidamente por varios expertos, se ha concluido que se trata de dos miembros salidos de la misma camada. 
Los dos gemeliers son idénticos en todo y se saben de memoria éxitos como “Grandes”, “No hay Nadie como tú” o “Chicas, Chicas”. “En ocasiones emiten sonidos, pero todavía no queremos aventurarnos a decir si se intentan comunicar con nosotros o si están creando una especie de estribillo”, explica el biólogo encargado de su estudio. 
Se cree que la cantidad de gemeliers que habitan en el territorio español puede alcanzar el millar de ejemplares, sin contar con los cientos de ellos que se encuentran de gira por México, Colombia y Ecuador. Ahora que dos de ellos se han juntado, preocupa que más especímenes proliferen sin control por la península, comunicándose entre ellos a kilómetros de distancia gracias a su complejo lenguaje basado en ritmos latinos y estribillos pegadizos. 
Varias protectoras han exigido que los gemeliers sean devueltos a su hábitat natural, en Sevilla, y que se les proteja de las legiones de fans y curiosos que destruyen su ecosistema y violan su intimidad.",1
27505, This New Ad Gives Us A Horrifyingly Realistic Preview Of ‘President Trump’ (VIDEO),"Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has redefined the election process. All predictions can be thrown out the window along with hope and human decency. In a decent society, if a presidential candidate was horrifically racist, they would be condemned. If they cursed and spoke in a totalitarian tone, they would be quickly ushered out of any hope of winning an election. However, this election seems different. People seem to be lining up behind Trump s racism, xenophobia and totalitarian rhetoric in huge numbers. Numbers reminiscent of another totalitarian regime that rose up in Europe during the 1930s and 40s.To be blunt, we cannot allow Donald Trump to win the Oval Office. Not only would it be bad for the nation, but it would be horrific for the entire world. Top foreign diplomats are already standing against Trump. They know how dangerous his rhetoric is.Trump s campaign isn t the joke campaign everyone originally made it out to be. No, he wants to be president, and that notion should scare the crap out of absolutely everyone worldwide. The leader of the free world can t be against half the people living in it.Showing Trump in his true form, American Future Fund put together an ad that puts Trump at the White House podium using his inflammatory and derogatory rhetoric, curse words and all. If seeing him at the podium doesn t light a fire under your ass to make sure he s never elected, then nothing will.Our nation is better than this. We re better than this. We cannot allow Trump to be President of the United States.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thw6k1XNRtcFeatured image via image screen capture",1
5804,"Baltimore, race and matters of perception","Comments about recent events in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray provide a glimpse at perhaps one of our greatest challenges — perception.

In this case, as in too many others involving police, perception seems to be black and white.

“I think that if you look at what’s happened over the course of the last year, you’ve just got to scratch your head,” said House Speaker John Boehner (R) on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” referring to the rash of fatal incidents involving police officers and African American males.

“I heard your call for ‘no justice, no peace,’ ” said Baltimore City State’s Attorney Marilyn Mosby (D) to demonstrators in her city and around the country, as she announced charges against six police officers involved in the arrest of Gray. To the youth of Baltimore, she declared, “Our time is now!” and urged peaceful demonstration.

Both comments made headlines. And both, though well intentioned, carried subliminal messages freighted with racial (not racist) undertones.

Boehner’s overly cautious remark was as starkly white as his OxiClean-ed, hand-pressed shirts. A man more accustomed to golf courses and marble hallways than to gritty urban streets, he was plainly trying to acknowledge that we have a police and race problem in the United States. But he sounded like he’d just landed on the planet.

Yes, quite head-scratching, all this police business.

Mosby’s remarks, jubilantly received by the Baltimore crowd, provoked high dudgeon elsewhere. Some of the words used to describe her performance have included “showboating,” “demagoguing” and “grandstanding.”

To some ears, Mosby sounded as though the cops’ convictions were a fait accompli. That she found the evidence convincing enough to justify the charges may ultimately also justify her bravura. Let’s do keep in mind that Gray’s offense was making eye contact with an officer and running away.

Gray’s voice box was crushed and his spine all but severed, according to his family. Anyone who watched the video could see that Gray was in terrible pain as he was led to the police van, where he was shackled and his pleas for help apparently ignored.

That his life ended in pain and horror is not in dispute. But no less a legal luminary than Alan Dershowitz has taken issue with the charges, saying, “There’s no plausible, hypothetical, conceivable case for murder under the facts as we now know them.”

Charges brought against the six officers included one count of second-degree murder, four counts of involuntary manslaughter, assault and misconduct in office.

In other words, Mosby threw everything she could against the six officers. Many have asked: For justice? Or to quell the passions of the streets? Perhaps both. Mosby surely calculated that announcing the charges as she did — with a microphone in a public place — would have a dramatic effect. (She declined to be interviewed for this column.)

Mosby also was speaking as a member of her community, long plagued with a history of police brutality, including last year’s fatal beating of Tyrone West. The medical examiner’s report concluded that West died of a prior heart condition that was exacerbated by dehydration, the July heat and his police encounter.

No charges were leveled against the police in that case. Thus, from the perspective of many among Baltimore’s protesters, the current charges are long overdue. Even so, one does worry that the six officers are paying not only for their role in Gray’s death, to whatever degree this is determined, but also for the cumulative sins of others.

To the officers, the cheering and horn-honking following Mosby’s words must have sounded like the Colosseum mob’s cry for blood. To an older generation of Americans, they were reminiscent of the reaction 20 years ago when a mostly black jury found O.J. Simpson not guilty of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman.

Whites: He totally did it.

African Americans: It’s our turn, in so many words.

This past week, whites across the United States spoke softly about the Freddie Gray case: “Thank God three of the cops were black.”

President Obama, speaking after Mosby leveled her charges, called for truth. How, indeed, do we get to it? In a diverse nation, we’ll never all see things exactly the same way, nor would we want to, but we might at least strive to recognize our own biases and judge our own perceptions as harshly as we do others’.

25317, Report: Donald Trump Tried To Back Out Of Pence Announcement,"Now that it s been established that Mike Pence will be Donald Trump s running mate (and not errand boy Chris Christie), the Clinton campaign has already begun pouncing on the anti-woman, anti-LGBT candidate that was brave enough to step on stage with Trump.But reports appear to show Trump had his reservations about the Indiana governor. Apparently, Trump was so regretful of picking the former Congressman that he asked his campaign aides   the night before the announcement   if he could back out of picking Pence.After the news leaked that Pence was indeed the choice, Trump s uncertainty was heightened after being incensed (he blamed the Pence camp). On Thursday, after telling Fox News he had not made a  final  decision, sources told NBC News:[D]onald Trump was stressed over the circumstances surrounding his choice for running mate even after news of the pick leaked. While in California, separated from family and most aides, Trump worked the phones late into the evening Thursday soliciting advice and sharing his concerns. Sources familiar with the calls said Trump conveyed that he felt  backed into a corner.  Another description suggested that Trump was talking it out, but knew that he could not and would not choose a different running mate.It hasn t even been two days and Trump already regrets his decision. Like everything else in his campaign, Trump seems to have been winging it the whole time, settling on a guy he wasn t even so sure about.The news that Pence was the choice shouldn t have been a surprise. For months the Trump campaign told reporters it was seeking an experienced Republican who had personal relationships on Capitol Hill. That left Pence and former House Speaker New Gingrich as the formidable options. But in the last several weeks the Trump campaign noted that it did not want an  attack dog,  which eliminated Gingrich   Christie was never a true option, he was just the McDonald s boy.Of course the Trump campaign denied that he had regrets, but considering their main attraction lies 77 percent of the time, who can be so sure?With the RNC just around the corner, Trump enters the general race universally hated, with no money, no field organization, and a running mate he doesn t really like.Yet his supporters will still view him as a god.Featured image via Bryan Thomas/Getty Images",1

Hillary Clin­ton faced an up­set in her run for the White House two days ago af­ter the FBI an­nounced a fresh probe into her emails. In­ves­ti­ga­tors will examine new mes­sages to see whether she sent clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion on a private server. Just ten days be­fore Amer­i­cans go to the polls, the Demo­crat candidate’s bid to be­come the first woman US pres­i­dent may be de­railed if it is de­cided she should face crim­i­nal charges. ‘I AM INNOCENT!’ Recent Polls sug­gest Mrs Clinton will trounce Repub­li­can ri­val Don­ald Trump, who has been strug­gling to fight al­le­ga­tions about grop­ing women. But Mrs Clin­ton will now be forced on the de­fen­sive her­self in the fi­nal days of their vi­cious elec­tion bat­tle. LD : The latest news is that Hillary’s 12-point lead has been “ wiped out ” within the last 24 hours, with Hillary now just one point ahead of Trump. This could of course change at any moment, with rapid fluctuations, depending on the volatility of the situation. FBI di­rec­tor James Comey had rec­om­mended ear­lier this year that the Department of Jus­tice not press charges over emails sent by Mrs Clin­ton when she was sec­re­tary of state un­der Barack Obama. But he said ‘re­cent de­vel­op­ments’ had prompted him to take an­other look.

A ju­bi­lant Mr Trump hailed the dra­matic de­vel­op­ment of a re-opened investigation as ‘big­ger than Water­gate’, a ref­er­ence to the cor­rup­tion scan­dal that brought down Richard Nixon. ‘Bigger than Watergate’ The con­tro­versy has weighed heav­ily on the cam­paign, chal­leng­ing Mrs Clinton’s key con­tention that – un­like her opponent – she would be a safe pair of hands in the White House. Mr Comey an­nounced in July that the FBI’s 12-month investigation into Mrs Clinton’s con­tro­ver­sial email traf­fic while secretary of state was over. She was crit­i­cised for us­ing a pri­vate email server rather than the of­fi­cial system to trans­mit clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion, but escaped prose­cu­tion. In a harshly-worded crit­i­cism of her ‘ex­treme care­less­ness’ and ‘gross negligence’, Mr Comey said it was pos­si­ble that hos­tile for­eign govern­ments had gained ac­cess to her poorly-pro­tected ac­count. He also flatly con­tra­dicted var­i­ous Clinton claims al­though – in ex­plain­ing why he had not rec­om­mended pros­e­cut­ing her – he ac­cepted there was no evidence she had in­ten­tion­ally jeop­ar­dised state se­crets. The scan­dal has been bran­dished by Repub­li­cans as ev­i­dence of Mrs Clin­ton’s dis­hon­esty and in­com­pe­tence. Mr Comey informed Congress by let­ter that his agency had ob­tained new emails. They will be re­viewed to see if they are sig­nif­i­cant and if new ac­tion against Mrs Clin­ton is re­quired. Mr Comey did not give a time­frame for how long this in­ves­ti­ga­tion will take. The orig­i­nal FBI probe found that of 30,000 emails Mrs Clin­ton handed over to the State Depart­ment, 110 con­tained in­for­ma­tion that was clas­si­fied at the time she sent or re­ceived them. How­ever, an­other 33,000 emails went miss­ing. They were pre­sumed to have been per­ma­nently deleted but newly re­leased FBI notes sug­gested they still ex­ist in sev­eral locations and could be re­cov­ered. It is un­clear whether any of these are in­volved in the new FBI in­quiry. Law en­force­ment of­fi­cials said the newly dis­cov­ered emails were taken from the elec­tronic de­vices of se­nior Clin­ton aide Huma Abe­din and her dis­graced hus­band An­thony Weiner dur­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion in the lat­ter’s ‘sex­ting’ of girls. ANTHONY WEINER AND HUMA ABEDIN 
Note by LD : Huma Abedin is an American Muslim of Indo-Pakistani descent. Weiner is a disgraced Jewish politician who has been involved in a series of sex scandals. When Huma found out about her husband’s sleazy sexual activities, she was forced to divorce him. This was in August 2016. The unlikely couple had been married for just over six years. 
As for Huma, her relationship with Hillary Clinton has been an extraordinarily close one for almost 20 years, so much so that there have been sensational rumors of a lesbian liaison . The view for popular consumption is that Hillary is Huma’s “mentor” and “mother figure”. Hillary once compared Huma to her own daughter Chelsea. “I have one daughter,” she said. “But if I had a second daughter, it would be Huma.” Huma’s real mother, noting that Hillary had now replaced her in her daughter’s affections, once told Hillary jokingly, “I’m jealous of you!” (See here ) 
John Lennon’s widow, Yoko Ono ( pictured ), claims to have had a lesbian affair with Hillary in the 1970s. “We met many times,” Yoko boasts, “and became very intimate !” (LD) 
TOM LEONARD continues : 
Weiner, a for­mer Demo­crat con­gress­man for New York, be­came em­broiled in a se­ries of scan­dals over ex­chang­ing sex­u­ally ex­plicit text mes­sages with a string of women. 
He sep­a­rated from Miss Abe­din, vice chair­man of the Clin­ton cam­paign, in Au­gust. 
It is un­der­stood the FBI is in­ves­ti­gat­ing Weiner af­ter it was re­vealed that he had been sex­ting a high school stu­dent who was 15 at the time. Mr Trump re­acted with de­light to Mrs Clin­ton’s 11th-hour elec­tion night­mare. 
Ad­dress­ing a ju­bi­lant crowd in New Hamp­shire, Trump said: 
‘ Hil­lary Clin­ton’s cor­rup­tion is on a scale we’ve never seen be­fore. We must not let her take her crim­i­nal scheme into the Oval Of­fice.’ Mr Trump had pre­vi­ously crit­i­cised the FBI and Depart­ment of Jus­tice for not bring­ing charges against his elec­tion opponent. His run­ning mate, Mike Pence, called on the FBI to im­me­di­ately re­lease all the emails per­ti­nent to the investigation, adding: ‘The Amer­i­can peo­ple have a right to know.’ The Repub­li­can vice pres­i­den­tial can­di­date told a rally in Penn­syl­va­nia, that he and Don­ald Trump ‘com­mend the FBI for hav­ing the courage to re­open the case’. Chants of ‘Lock her up!’ came even be­fore Mr Pence ref­er­enced the FBI investigation. Mrs Clin­ton ig­nored shouted ques­tions from re­porters about the new FBI investigation as she walked off her plane in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. House Speaker Paul Ryan, the most se­nior Repub­li­can in Congress, said she had be­trayed Amer­i­cans’ trust for han­dling ‘the na­tion’s most im­por­tant secrets. HOT NEWS!

26134, Oklahoma Republicans Are Trying To Impeach Obama For The Dumbest Reason Yet,"Talk of impeaching our first African-American President is like oxygen to Republicans   if they don t mention it incessantly, their tiny little brains shrivel up and they die. This is a scientific fact that I completely made up but has a strong basis in reality. Our frenemies on the right have come up with some real doozies when explaining their repeated attempts to get the black man out of the WHITE house.In 2010, Michigan Rep. Tim Walberg wanted to impeach Barack Obama in an effort to get his birth certificate. In 2012, former Minnesota state Rep. Allen Quist said that the President should be impeached because he isn t deporting brown people quickly enough. That same year, Texas congressional candidate Wes Riddle decided the black man should be impeached for satisfying the conditions of a treaty ratified under George H.W. Bush. A year prior, Tea Party Texas Rep. Michael Burgess suggested impeachment for no better reason than to block Obama s agenda. The month before that, GOP Rep. Tim Scott wanted Obama impeached because he wouldn t allow the country to default on its debts. Weeks after that, Rep. Steve King agreed with this ridiculous notion.If we were to translate all of these moronic reasons to impeach the President, they all boil down to one thing:  He s black.  But as monumentally stupid as those are, Oklahoma s state legislature has managed to come up with some new and original that dwarfs all previous reasons Republicans wanted to impeach the President in the scale of their stupidity. Reuters reports that Oklahoma Republicans have filed a measure calling for Obama s impeachment because of   Lawmakers say they want to get President Obama out of office because he overstepped his constitution authority by protecting transgender students from being harassed by their ideological counterparts across the nation. In fact, they feel so strongly on the issue that are already taking up a measure that would allow students to claim a religious right to have  separate but equal  (where have we heard that phrase before?) bathrooms and changing facilities to keep them away from scary transgender people:Lawmakers in the socially conservative state are also expected to take up a measure as early as Friday that would allow students to claim a religious right to have separate but equal bathrooms and changing facilities to segregate them from transgender students.The bill introduced on Thursday night could force schools into costly construction, which would be difficult for them to complete after lawmakers significantly cut education funding to plug a $1.3 billion state budget shortfall.The impeachment resolution also introduced on Thursday night calls on the Oklahoma members of the U.S. House of Representatives to file articles of impeachment against Obama, the U.S. attorney general, the U.S. secretary of education and others over the letter.Oklahoma state Rep. John Bennett called President Obama s tyrannical decree that transgender people deserve equal rights  Biblically wrong    a phrase that should never enter politics   and a violation of state sovereignty. In a time when our state is facing an unprecedented economic crisis, our lawmakers should be focused on righting the ship rather than stigmatizing transgender youth,  Troy Stevenson, executive director of LGBT advocacy group Freedom Oklahoma, said of this ridiculous resolution.This decision comes on the heels of Oklahoma Republicans  decision to make it a felony to perform abortions. Not only would doctors face time behind bars, but they would be  prohibited from obtaining or renewing a license to practice medicine in this state  if they allow a woman to choose whether or not to carry a fetus to term. The bill passed the House 59-9 and the Senate 32-12, so it seems likely that something equally asinine   like impeaching Obama over something stupid   would be just as popular.Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",1
56724,Caribbean oil terminals make preparations ahead of Hurricane Maria,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Several Caribbean oil storage terminals that temporarily closed ahead of Hurricane Irma earlier this month have started making preparations in case they have to shut again due to Hurricane Maria, which was a rare Category 5 storm on Tuesday.  Shippers and traders in the Atlantic basin are struggling amid this year s very active storm season, which has seen seven hurricanes so far, four of them major hurricanes, defined as at least a Category 3 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. Hurricane Harvey hit the U.S. Gulf Coast s energy infrastructure at the end of August, halting a large portion of fuel exports to Latin America. This month, hurricanes Irma and Maria have forced Caribbean oil terminals and refineries to shut or slow operations, locking down millions of barrels stored. The scramble for shipments has led some shippers to divert tankers away from Venezuela to feed Latin American and Caribbean countries desperate for fuel. Maria on Tuesday evening churned in the eastern Caribbean about 60 miles (190 km) southeast of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where a 13-million-barrel oil storage facility is located. Operators of other terminals in neighboring islands were monitoring the storm before making operational decisions. The hurricane brushed north of St. Lucia and its path could also include St. Eustatius, Puerto Rico and parts of the Bahamas, islands where most of Caribbean s 100-million-barrel storage capacity is located. NuStar Energy s 13-million-barrel Statia terminal in St. Eustatius remains shut since earlier this month after some of its tanks suffered damage from Irma, according to the company. It also activated a hurricane response plan ahead of Maria. Statoil s South Riding Point terminal in the Bahamas remained open on Tuesday, though the company is monitoring the hurricane, it said in an email to Reuters. U.S.-based Buckeye Partners, the largest terminal operator in the Caribbean, said in an emailed statement that it  initiated full plant shutdown procedures and suspended all marine terminal operations for its operations in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico per our established hurricane preparedness plan.    Buckeye temporarily shut its 23-million-barrel Bahamas terminal, its 6-million-barrel Puerto Rico facility and its Florida pipeline and terminal system earlier in September due to Irma, but all of them were in the process of resuming operations last week. Maria caused  mind boggling damage  in Dominica, where it ripped off roofs across the island before pushing on toward the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Tuesday. ",0
56781,Turkey warns of global conflict if Iraq or Syria break up,"SIRNAK, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkey escalated its opposition to a Kurdish independence referendum in northern Iraq on Tuesday, training tank guns and rocket launchers across the southern border and saying the break-up of its neighbors could lead to global conflict. Defense Minister Nurettin Canikli said in Ankara next Monday s vote posed a major risk and Turkey would take  every step  needed to thwart any similar steps in its mainly Kurdish southeast. Iraqi Kurdish authorities have defied growing international pressure to call off the vote, which Iraq s neighbors fear will fuel unrest among their own Kurdish populations. Western allies say it could detract from the fight against Islamic State.  A change that will mean the violation of Iraq s territorial integrity poses a major risk for Turkey,  Canikli said.  The disruption of Syria and Iraq s territorial integrity will ignite a bigger, global conflict with an unseen end.  Kurds in north Syria, like those in Iraq, have capitalized on the turmoil in both countries to consolidate a degree of autonomy. Washington has supported Syrian Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State, despite Turkish protests.  Turkish troops dug in on the southern border on Tuesday and turned their weapons toward Kurdish-run northern Iraq. Tanks and rocket launchers mounted on armored vehicles faced the Iraqi frontier, about 2 km (one mile) away. Mechanical diggers tore up agricultural fields for the army to set up positions in the flat, dry farmlands. The military drill, launched without warning on Monday, is due to last until Sept. 26, Turkish military sources said, a day after the planned referendum. A Reuters reporter saw armored vehicles carrying heavy weaponry and soldiers taking positions in specially dug areas, their weapons directed across the border. A generator and satellite dish could be seen at one location. The show of force reflects the scale of concern in Turkey, which has the largest Kurdish population in the region, that the vote could embolden the outlawed Kurdish PKK which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey s southeast since 1984. The Turkish air force has frequently struck against PKK units operating from the mountains of northern Iraq and limited detachments of Turkish infantry have made forays across the frontier in the past. Turkey also sees itself as protector of Iraq s ethnic Turkmen minority, with particular concern about Kirkuk where Kurds have extended their control since seizing the oil city when Islamic State overwhelmed Iraqi forces in 2014. Police deployed overnight in Kirkuk to prevent any outbreak of ethnic violence, residents said. The standoff has hit the Turkish lira, which weakened beyond 3.5 to the dollar on Tuesday for the first time in four weeks.  The increasing tension before the referendum in northern Iraq continues to effect lira negatively,  Kapital FX Research Assistant Manager Enver Erkan said. Cross-border trade, however, appeared to continue. Despite the nearby military maneuvers a kilometer-long line of traffic, mostly trucks and cargo, queued to enter Iraq at the Habour border gate. Turkey s strong economic ties to the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) will weigh on any response from Ankara. The KRG pumps hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil per day through Turkey and has approved plans for Russian oil major Rosneft to invest in pipelines to export gas to Turkey and Europe. The military exercises came as Turkey, the central government in Baghdad and their shared neighbor Iran all stepped up protests and warnings about the independence referendum in the semi-autonomous Kurdish northern Iraq. The United States and other Western countries have also voiced concerns and asked Iraqi Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani to call off the vote, citing fears the referendum could distract attention from the fight against Islamic State militants. Iraq s Supreme Federal Court ordered Barzani to suspend the vote and approved Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi s demand to consider  the breakaway of any region or province from Iraq as unconstitutional , his office said on Monday. Turkey has brought forward to Friday a cabinet meeting and a session of its national security council to consider possible action. ",0

Paul International Airport. Now, new tours make it easy to follow the Prince trail around town. Waconiaville Tours, which specializes in winery visits, has added a Prince Tour that stops at Paisley Park, the home and studio of the star in suburban Chanhassen, which is not open to the public his former school the first theater where he performed and the Electric Fetus, said to be his favorite record store in the Twin Cities. The tours, which will run four to five hours, are to begin May 28 ($58). “We thought we would let the dust settle a bit, but a lot of people were asking for tours and there’s a story to be told,” said Randy Luedtke, the owner of Waconiaville Tours. To encourage   visitors, the tourism association Meet Minneapolis has published an online guide to the former homes, schools and clubs where Prince lived, studied and played. The list also features sites including the esteemed music club First Avenue, Cedar Lake and the Orpheum Theater where scenes from the 1984 Prince film “Purple Rain” were shot. “For a lot of us, he was a celebrity, but for many of us here he was a neighbor,” said Bill Deef, vice president of Meet Minneapolis. The association’s guide lists about 20 sites and includes maps for   tours. The city’s   program Nice Ride also has a   “   ” tour that visits four sites, including the house from “Purple Rain” and the nightclub formerly known as Glam Slam when Prince owned it. Venues where Prince performed and attended shows including First Avenue and the Dakota Jazz Club make it easy to experience the musical side of Minneapolis. “We remain true to his legacy and we hope to embody everything he was, which is liberation and the freedom to be yourself,” said Dayna Frank, the owner of First Avenue.",0
2400,Turley on Comey Firing: ’It Seems to Be a Cover-Up in Search of a Crime’ - Breitbart,"Friday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” George Washington law professor Jonathan Turley discussed Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s role in appointing a special prosecutor to investigate alleged ties between the Trump 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government.  According to Turley, the underlying crime isn’t clear given the lack of evidence with the exception of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s indiscretions, which he argued would not warrant special counsel. Turley described it as a “  in search of a crime. ” “For weeks I’ve questioned the need for special counsel because honestly I still don’t see the underlying crime here,” Turley said. “You know, when we talk about the Russian influence and collusion, there’s not any evidence I’ve seen of collusion but more importantly, no one has articulated a major crime, as opposed to the reporting and registration violations of people like Flynn, which usually wouldn’t warrant a special counsel. But that’s the great mystery here. ” “You know, with Watergate that people have been talking about, there was a serious crime that began that led to the ” he continued. “Here you seem to have a   without a crime. That’s what’s so bizarre about the conduct of the White House. It seems to be a   in search of a crime. The problem with the special counsel is what will the special counsel investigate? But having said that, after they fired Comey, my view is that it’s changed, that we do need an independent investigation simply because the White House has created a credibility problem. And lots of Americans believe that there is an effort here to obstruct the investigation. (  RCP Video) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
21604, New Research Shows Trump’s Border Wall Will Be Even MORE Worthless Than We Thought (DETAILS)," Build the wall! Build the wall!  Supposedly nobody builds better walls than Donald Trump, and the government is already hard at work acquiring the land and materials necessary to build a wall that s likely to do nothing to stop people from crossing the southern border. Now, a new study shows that the border wall may also be more a more unjustified waste of money than ever.Illegal immigration has been falling since 2007, but this latest bit of research out of the University of California, San Diego, says it will continue to fall. It s partly because of Obama   contrary to what xenophobic conservatives say, Obama did not favor or enable an open border. He made stemming the flow of immigrants a priority of his administration. The right wing is pissed because he also worked to protect people who were already here.However, the biggest causes of the drop are actually far more subtle and beyond the control of even the most hard-line, xenophobic White House. Economic trends, such as falling demand for low-skilled workers, play a huge role too. That s a long-term trend that these researchers don t see reversing itself anytime soon.There s also a major demographic component to this   our baby boom ended rather quickly in the early 1960s. However, in Latin America, it fell off far more gradually, resulting in a much larger number of younger Latin American workers who could find better opportunities here, in the 1990s and early 2000s, than in their home countries.That also is no longer true. The birth rate in Latin America is now about the same as ours, resulting in a falloff in the number of people trying to come here for opportunity. Furthermore, the population of undocumented immigrants that we do have is aging. Over the next few decades, they ll be forced to either start paying ridiculous medical bills out of pocket, or they ll find themselves forced to return to their home countries.If you combine these factors, the number of people trying to cross the border illegally will continue to drop. In fact, the researchers believe it will fall sharply over the next 20 years even without a wall.And yet, here s Trump and all his loyal subjects still chanting that a wall, which will cost anywhere from $21 billion to $70 billion and take years to build, is absolutely necessary to securing the border. But nobody actually knows how much money we could waste on this wall because no reliable estimates exist. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, there are too  many variables that are currently unknown  to be able to accurately estimate this cost.Yet they re asking for $2.6 billion for just 71 miles of new barriers for FY2018. That s a lot of money for less than 100 miles of barrier.We already knew that we, the taxpayers, were going to foot the bill for something that s probably not going to work. But now we re going to foot the bill for something that isn t just ineffective, but is wholly unnecessary.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",1
21900, Desperate GOP LITERALLY Spreads Trump’s Wiretap Lies To Fleece Their Supporters,"It was bound to happen   as soon as House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes said that he had evidence people in Trump s transition team were recorded during foreign surveillance activities, Trump and his loyal subjects within the Republican Party pounced. Never mind what else Nunes said that the information collected was incidental and probably legal the GOP saw their opportunity to clear their president s name and paint Obama as the evil, criminal, dictatorial president they always  knew  he was.The National Republican Congressional Committee sent out emails this morning with the subject line,  Confirmed: Obama spied on Trump.  They quoted Politico:  Trump transition members were under surveillance during Obama administration.  And they quoted Nunes:  Members of the Donald Trump transition team, possibly including Trump himself, were under surveillance during the Obama administration following November s election. Here s the full letter:Whoa. as flagged by the DCCC, Republicans are now fundraising on the false claim that Obama spied on Trump pic.twitter.com/AKzw3jAAQJ  Sam Stein (@samsteinhp) March 23, 2017Is there context? Of course not. That s nonexistent in their letter, but here s some: The quote from the Politico story is the caption on top of the video they posted of Nunes  press conference. And here s some more relevant context from that story: Nunes set off the firestorm with a news conference earlier in the day in which he described the surveillance of Trump aides through what s called  incidental collection,  something he noted was routine and legal. Such collection can occur when a person inside the United State communicates with a foreign target of U.S. surveillance. In such cases, the identities of U.S. citizens are supposed to be shielded   but can be  unmasked  by intelligence officials under certain circumstances. Furthermore, Nunes himself said: This is a normal, incidental collection, based on what I could collect. It alarms him anyway, for some reason.However, more significant than that is the fact that Nunes also said yesterday that he still has no evidence Trump, his team, or his campaign were wiretapped or otherwise the target of surveillance by the Obama administration. None. Zero, zip, zilch, nada.  I have said this for many, many weeks,  he told White House reporters.What we have now is a party that s actively and knowingly spreading Trump s lies to gain an edge they know they re losing. Should investigations conclude that not only did a sitting president level a demonstrably false accusation against his predecessor, but also that he colluded with Russia during the election cycle, the GOP is sunk.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images",1
52458,UCLA basketball players arrested in China ahead of Trump's visit: reports,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Three UCLA men s basketball players were arrested in China for shoplifting on Tuesday, media said, a day before U.S. President Donald Trump arrived on his first official visit. The players arrested were freshmen LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, according to USA Today, the Los Angeles Times and ESPN, all of which cited unnamed sources familiar with the incident. Ball is the younger brother of National Basketball Association rookie Lonzo Ball of the Los Angeles Lakers. Reached by telephone at a hotel in the eastern city of Hangzhou on Wednesday, Ball declined to comment. ESPN said the three had been picked up by police at their hotel on Tuesday  and released on bail early on Wednesday. They were confined to their hotel pending legal proceedings, it said. The University of California, Los Angeles, declined to confirm the arrests but said it was  aware of a situation involving UCLA student-athletes in Hangzhou, China .  The university is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time,  UCLA Athletics said in a statement provided by spokeswoman Shana Wilson. The UCLA team had arrived in China on Sunday with plans to play Georgia Tech in both teams  regular-season opener on Saturday, according to statements from both teams. It traveled to Hangzhou, about three hours by bus from Shanghai, to visit the campus of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), sponsor of the annual Pac-12 games in China. The three players were questioned about stealing from a Louis Vuitton store next to the hotel where the team is staying, ESPN said. UCLA representatives, including coach Steve Alford, were at the police station while they were there, it said, citing an unidentified source. Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement the conference was  disappointed by any situation that detracts from the positive student-athlete educational and cultural experience that this week is about.   Whether in the United States or abroad, we expect our student-athletes to uphold the highest standards. We will continue to closely monitor the situation,  he said. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Wednesday the Chinese government had reported the case to the U.S. side in accordance with consular agreements.  China is handling this case in accordance with the law and will guarantee the lawful rights in accordance with the law of those involved in this case,  she said. In a video posted on Twitter on Wednesday by Arash Markazi, a senior writer at ESPN, LaVar Ball said his son, LiAngelo, would be fine.  He ll be fine. Everyone s making it a big deal. It ain t that big a deal,  said Ball, the outspoken CEO of athletic apparel maker Big Baller Brand. Chinese President Xi Jinping led Trump on a private tour of the Forbidden City to kick off his visit on Wednesday. White House officials could not be immediately reached for  comment. Alibaba declined to comment, as did the Hangzhou police. A U.S. State Department official said the department was aware of reports of three citizens arrested in China and stood ready to provide assistance but had no further comment due to privacy considerations. Three players from Georgia Tech were questioned by the authorities in China on Tuesday at their hotel in Hangzhou but were later released by police, Georgia Tech athletics spokesman Mike Flynn said in a statement.  During the questioning, it was determined that Georgia Tech student-athletes were not involved in the activities being investigated. They have resumed their scheduled activities,  Flynn said. ",0

No surprise here. From Israels POV ,” what’s not to like” about her. She’s there biggest supporter. The darling of the neo-con warmongers. The favorite of both the Democrat and “Republican” establishment elites (hence McCain in the video). I did have to gag a little at the praise about her moral,principled,leadership qualities though. And especially with Peres talking about her knowing that “peace” required time to accomplish. The Israelis know a “thing or two” about the “time issue”.They’ve stalled any moves for peace for over 60 years already. And will for another 60 if they can. Reply - Share",1
10456,Surviving Off-grid: 5 Ways to Manage Chimney Creosote,"Carmela Tyrell November 6, 2016 Surviving Off-grid: 5 Ways to Manage Chimney Creosote 
The government is doing everything it can to deter people from burning wood , it still remains popular with home owners that don’t want to use oil or other more expensive fuels. Wood is also very popular with off gridders, preppers, and homesteaders because it can be harvested from natural resources or grown for this purpose. 
Many people that burn wood are plagued by creosote that builds up in chimneys. As dangerous as this problem can become, preventing or reducing creosote buildup is not as hard as it seems to be. 
Here are five ways you can reduce or prevent creosote buildup in your chimneys. 
Do not forget to inspect your chimneys on a regular basis and clean them even if the creosote only looks like it is in the early stages of buildup. 
How Does Creosote Form? 
Have you ever blown on a mirror or piece of glass so that some of the water vapor from your lungs condenses on the glass? If so, then you may also know that condensation occurs because the glass is cooler than the air exiting your mouth. 
In a similar way, when hot gas and smoke enter the chimney, they are hotter than the stove pipe. If the pipe is not hot enough, then creosote will condense out of the smoke and be deposited in the chimney. Video first seen on Corey Binford . 
The Three Degrees of Creosote Buildup 
As with many other situations in life, creosote build up may not be especially dangerous at first. However, if it is left unchecked, or not taken care of soon enough, it can become a very expensive problem. As you review the three degrees of creosote buildup, bear in mind that simply cleaning up the mess is only part of the problem. You will still need to take active steps to prevent or at least slow down further creosote buildup. 
1st Degree 
Just about every chimney will build up layers of soft black material known as soot. If you can easily brush the black layer of material out of the chimney, chances are there is actually very little creosote in it. 
Many people consider this a good sign because it means the fire is burning hot enough to reduce the amount of temperature difference between the smoke and the chimney. While this stage isn’t especially dangerous, you will still need to clean out the chimney on a routine basis in order to keep good air flow. 
2nd Degree 
At this level, you will start to see more creosote in the soot. There will be quite a few shiny black flakes of material that can still be removed if you put some effort into it. If you see this kind of soot, it is very important to increase the air flow in the burning area. 
3rd Degree 
This type of creosote buildup forms layers of a tar like coating on inner surfaces of the chimney. If you think about how cholesterol builds up in arteries, then you have a pretty good picture of what I mean. 
3 rd Degree creosote also contains a good bit of unburned fuel . As a result, when it does catch fire, it can be quite dangerous. The third degree of creosote buildup is caused by cool burning fires with inadequate ventilation, or by a flue that is too large. 
Here are five ways to resolve this type of buildup. You may need a combination of answers in order to reduce the level of creosote buildup as much as possible. 
1. Keep a Robust Airflow 
Have you ever lit a candle, and then put it in a glass cup? If so, then you have also probably seen soot build up on the sides of the glass. 
When a fire burns under any kind of restricted air flow, the soot from the fire will also concentrate and condense into smaller areas. Typically, fireplaces that have glass doors, or are otherwise closed off will have the most problems with airflow. 
Here’s what you can do to remedy this problem: Keep the ash bin and grate area as clean as possible. Open the damper so that more air gets into the fireplace. If you cannot get enough air moving in the fireplace, try using a fan or blower to push more air in through the damper. Make sure that the fan is made of metal or some other non-flammable material. Aside from purchasing a new model, you may also find some old, or vintage blowers at a flea market for a much lower price. Never underestimate the power or durability of these old, but incredibly durable blowers and fans! In some cases, downdrafts from the outside can also cause poor air circulation inside the stove. You can try adding a partial cover to the top of outer pipe. Alternatively, add an insert with an inward curve that will also reduce the amount of downdraft that can get down the chimney. 
2. Keep the Fire Hot 
Even though you may think of a piece of wood as a single object, it is actually made up of all kinds of molecules. This, in turn, means that some molecules will have a higher kindling point than others. 
If the fire is not hot enough, some of the molecules that require a hotter temperature will escape into the chimney and form a layer of creosote if the conditions are right. Later on, if the temperature inside the chimney gets hot enough, these particles will catch fire and burn. 
The hotter the fire is, the better chance there is of these molecules being reduced to heat and ash in the fireplace. In addition, the hotter the fire is, the hotter the chimney will be. When the chimney is hot enough, all the gunk that forms creosote cannot collect. 
Here are some ways to increase the heat output from a wood fire: add a few handfuls of coal to the wood fire. Coal burns at a higher temperature and will also last longer. Without a question, anyone that has used a coal fire on a freezing winter night can tell you just how delightful they are! install heat retaining bricks in the fireplace. This will increase the temperature inside the burn area and help keep the temperature steadier. insulate the chimney pipe with bricks. This is especially important if you are using a metal chimney, as they will always be cooler on the inner surface. The insulation will help, however it will not entirely solve the problem if it is caused by using a metal chimney. 
3. Check the Size of the Flue 
Consider a situation where you want to heat up a cup of coffee over a campfire. Chances are it will only take a few minutes to achieve this goal. Now let’s say you want to heat up a gallon of water over the exact same campfire. 
Heating up a gallon of water will take longer than a cup because there are more atoms to deal with. In a similar way, when the flue is too large, there is simply too much material for the fire to contend with. A wood stove should not have a flue larger than six inches. 
When you reduce the size of the flue, it allows less heat to escape. Some people have noticed a 20% or better increase in heat produced by fireplaces that have an optimally sized flue. Therefore, you will be reducing creosote problems and get more heat at the same time. 
Depending on the construction of the stove and chimney system, you may not be able to simply rip the whole thing out and start over again. Your best option will be to insert a sleeve into the chimney so that it has a smaller internal diameter. Even though these sleeves are usually made of metal, the surrounding brick in the chimney should keep it warm enough to reduce the risk of creosote build up. If you still get too much creosote, focus on increasing the heat produced by the fire and the amount of air flow going up into the chimney. Remember, the more air flow you have going up the chimney, the harder it will be for particles to stay still long enough to attach to inner surfaces. You may also want to let the wood season longer than a few months, and choose some type of wood other than pine. Look for wood that has less resin or sap in it. It is also very important to stay away from pellets or other types of pre-manufactured wood because they may be designed to burn at lower temperatures than what you will need to heat up an over sized chimney. 
4. Make Sure the Wood is Fully Seasoned and Dry 
Have you ever tried to start a fire during or after it rains? If you are camping, chances are you use a number of methods to dry the wood out as much as possible so that it produces more heat than smoke. 
In a similar way, when wood is not fully seasoned and dried out, it will produce more creosote. Fires that produce a lot of smoke also have the following problems: there is less airflow, which reduces the amount of oxygen available to the fire the fire will burn cooler because water impedes combustion smoke is also a sign that more fuel is escaping into the air than you would get from a cleaner burning fire. 
There is no substitute for time when it comes to seasoning wood. You can try keeping logs closer to the fire place for a few days before you actually burn them. Just remember to rotate them often so that the log dries out more evenly. 
Chopping the log into smaller pieces might help too. This will increase surface area, which in turn will speed up water evaporation. You will still need to rotate the wood around to ensure the fastest possible drying. 
When it comes to seasoning wood , many people make the mistake of covering the wood with a waterproof, air tight tarp. The wood will release water vapor, however it will fall right back onto the wood and be absorbed all over again. 
You will be better served by keeping the wood loosely covered and in a warm, sunny spot while it is drying. As with drying the wood out indoors, do not forget to rotate the woodpile every few days so that the pieces dry out as much and as evenly as possible. 
If the weather is especially damp, humid, or rainy, it may be of some help to cut the wood into smaller pieces. No matter how you look at it, increasing surface area always speeds up evaporation. It may seem like a lot of extra work, however it will pay off when you have hotter fires   and fewer problems with creosote. 
5. Do Not Overload the Stove With Wood 
When you have had a long, hard day, it is tempting to load the stove with as much wood as possible so you won’t have to add more through the night. On the other side of the equation, when you put too much wood in the stove, it reduces air flow. 
Aside from this, when fires burn, they also release some water vapor. When there is too much wood in the stove, some of that vapor may just land on the wood and increase its moisture level. No matter how well seasoned the wood is, that increased moisture will cause the fire to burn poorly. 
Here are some ways to resolve this problem: start off by adding just one piece at a time to the fire. If the fire burns well, try adding a second piece. Keep adding more pieces as long as the fire burns cleanly. Do not forget that you may not be able to add as many pieces at one time on rainy days or ones where it is impossible to prevent a downdraft from the chimney. install an automatic wood feeder. Even thought a wood feeder can take up a good bit of space, it may be a better solution than trying to manually feed the stove. Use coal and other materials that might burn longer during times when you won’t be available to feed the stove more wood. 
Wherever you live in (an apartment or a house), chances are the building will have a chimney, and there will also be a stove available for burning wood . Getting started with wood burning is not especially difficult, but avoiding creosote buildup in the chimney can be challenge. 
Be careful about the condition of the fire, the wood, and ventilation issues that may lead to creosote buildup. Once you find a way to reduce the speed of creosote buildup, do not forget to inspect the chimney on a regular basis. 
A clean chimney is not just a safe one, it is a valuable asset that will help you burn wood efficiently and get the most from it.

51346,Philippines set to keep open pit mining ban as Duterte rejects call to lift it,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine environment minister said on Wednesday that a ban on new open pit mining in the country would remain in place, with President Rodrigo Duterte rejecting government panel recommendations to reverse it. The ban, implemented by former environment minister Regina Lopez from April covers new projects including the $5.9-billion copper-gold Tampakan project in southern Mindanao island, the biggest stalled mining venture in the Southeast Asian nation.  The President sets the policy. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources will implement what the President deems as best for the country s interest,  Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Roy Cimatu told Reuters in a text message. Open pit mining is allowed under the laws of the Southeast Asian country, the world s top nickel ore exporter, where many mines use it to extract minerals. But Lopez said the process ruins the economic potential of places where it is carried out. Duterte said late on Tuesday that he had rejected a recommendation by the Mining Industry Coordinating Council (MICC) to lift the ban because such mining is  destroying the soil and environment and no corrective measure is immediately (being) implemented . He added that while mining brings  good profit , he  can let it go . The comments by the firebrand leader followed an announcement on Monday by his spokesman that Duterte had not reversed the ban. The MICC, an inter-agency panel that makes recommendations on mining policy, is chaired by Cimatu and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez. Cimatu said last month that he supported the removal of the open pit ban and that his agency would strengthen regulations to prevent any excesses by miners. The ban would further halt development of the Tampakan project in the southern South Cotabato province. The project was first stopped after South Cotabato banned open-pit mining in 2010, and operator Glencore Plc quit the project five years later. Lopez, who stepped down in May after failing to win congressional confirmation after 10 months in office, has said the project would cover an area the size of 700 soccer fields in what otherwise would be agricultural land. Also covered by the ban is the $1.2 billion Silangan copper and gold mine in Mindanao by Philippine miner Philex Mining Corp. ",0
47257,New York City to pursue sweeping homelessness reforms: mayor,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City will implement a raft of reforms to combat its high level of homelessness, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday, following a three-month review of the problem. In New York, the United States’ largest city, around 58,000 people sleep in shelters each night, representing the largest homeless population for any U.S. metropolitan area, according to the National Alliance to end Homelessness. Nearly half of those homeless are children. The changes announced on Monday are intended to address the issue in four key areas: preventing at-risk residents from losing their homes, moving homeless out of shelters and into permanent housing, improving conditions at shelters and reducing the number of homeless who sleep in the streets. “We know the status quo has not been working,” de Blasio said at Bronxworks, a nonprofit that helps impoverished families. “We don’t accept that status quo. Today begins a new approach.” The number of homeless has more than doubled from around 23,000 two decades ago and has remained stubbornly high, leaving de Blasio’s administration open to criticism. New York’s large shelter population is in part due to a landmark court case that established a “right to shelter” mandate requiring city authorities to provide housing for those without it. In response, the mayor has proposed spending an additional $66 million dollars to fight the problem, though he said the organizational changes announced on Monday would lead to savings of $38 million to help offset those new costs. The city’s Human Resources Administration and Department of Homeless Services will report to a single commissioner and share administrative duties, de Blasio said, eliminating some bureaucratic redundancies. The city will use data analytics to identify at-risk families and increase its use of legal assistance and rental aid to avoid evictions. De Blasio also said the city would conduct more inspections of shelters and crack down on not-for-profit agencies that fail to provide safe and adequate shelters. The New York City police department is already in the process of retraining so-called peace officers who share security responsibility with private guards at the city’s more than 250 shelters. The city is also reinstating a dormant program that provided domestic violence services in shelters, after the review found 60 percent of violent episodes in family shelters were due to domestic violence. The issue gained more attention in February, when a homeless woman and two of her young children were stabbed to death at a hotel used by the city to house homeless families. The woman’s boyfriend was charged with murder. ",0
41381,Trump's concession on wall funding removes obstacle from spending talks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The threat of a U.S. government shutdown this weekend appeared to recede on Tuesday after President Donald Trump backed away from a demand that Congress include funding for his planned border wall with Mexico in a spending bill.  Even if the fight over wall funding is over, Republicans and Democrats still have difficult issues to resolve as they face a Friday night deadline when existing money expires for many federal agencies.  There was growing sentiment among lawmakers that they would need to pass a short-term extension of current spending, possibly of one week’s duration, in order to finish negotiating longer-term legislation for funding the government through the end of September. “Yeah, it looks like it,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Appropriations Committee member, when asked about the likelihood of a short-term extension. But on Tuesday night, some leading Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate expressed optimism that Congress could pass the longer-term bill and avoid having to rely on another temporary extension of last year’s funding levels. “We’re really close,” said Republican Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee.  He added that leadership would make the final decision on which course Congress takes this week. Trump removed a crucial sticking point when he said on Monday he may wait until Republicans begin drafting the budget blueprint for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1 to seek wall funding. The president’s fellow Republicans control both chambers of Congress, but the current spending bill will need 60 votes to clear the 100-member Senate, where Republicans hold only 52 seats. Democratic leaders had said they would not support a bill that included funds for the wall. The border wall was one of Trump’s signature election pledges last year, with the Republican touting it as best way to stop illegal immigrants and drugs from coming into the country. If no spending measure covering April 29 to Sept. 30 is in place before 12:01 a.m. (0401 GMT) on Saturday, government funds will halt and hundreds of thousands of the country’s several million federal employees will be temporarily laid off. Trump had run the risk of being blamed by Democrats for a shutdown, which would start on his 100th day in office. Representative Steny Hoyer, the second most powerful Democrat in the House, said he would advise colleagues to support a short-term funding proposal only if a longer-term fix was imminent. Short-term funding measures, known as continuing resolutions and covering periods of days or weeks, have been used to avert shutdowns in the past. But in 2013, conservative Republicans forced a 17-day shutdown in a failed attempt to repeal then-President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer welcomed Trump’s Monday night comments and noted there were Republican opponents of the wall too. “It’s really good news that the president seems to be taking the wall off the table,” Schumer said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. “It would remove the prospect of a needless fight over a poison pill proposal that members of both parties don’t support.” Late on Tuesday, however, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told CNN that Trump would not agree to other concessions that Democrats had sought - cost-sharing healthcare subsidies for 6 million Americans. The subsidies are part of the Affordable Care Act health insurance law, commonly called Obamacare.  Mulvaney said the White House had offered Democrats to include the Obamacare subsidies in exchange for funding the wall.   “But they said no to that and we agreed to put that off for another day,” he said. By dropping his call for immediate funding for the wall, Trump may clear a path to a spending bill. But he will lose an opportunity to display serious progress on accomplishing his agenda since taking office on Jan. 20.  There is also no guarantee that Congress will want to fund the wall later on, given skepticism running through the Republican Party.   Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who represents the border state of Arizona, told reporters on Tuesday there was a need for a wall in some border locations and alternative deterrents in others. “A lot of us have been pushing for additional border security funding for a while, but a solitary 2,000-mile wall has never been a must-have for anybody in a border state,” he said.  Trump said he had not changed his stance, tweeting on Tuesday: “It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc.” Trump has said Mexico will eventually repay the United States for wall construction, but the Mexican government has been adamant it will not do so, and Trump has not laid out  plans to compel repayment. Internal Department of Homeland Security estimates have put the cost at $21.6 billion. Republican Senator Roger Wicker said there was a “substantial figure” in the spending bill dedicated to border security. Such spending, not explicitly for a wall, would likely be acceptable to both parties. ",0
3682,Why Rachel Dolezal's assertion that she is black could pave way for folks choosing a 'racial identity',"Rachel Dolezal, the former head of the Spokane NAACP, has insisted she is black, despite having white parents. She has been quoted as saying, ""That question is not as easy as it seems. There's a lot of complexities ... and I don't know that everyone would understand that.""

I do understand. Years ago, even before Sen. Elizabeth Warren was exposed for identifying herself as Native American (which she is not), I believe I was the first person in the world to assert that transgender activism by Chaz Bono (and now by Caitlyn Jenner) could sow the seeds for people not only to assert their core gender identities, despite DNA evidence to the contrary, but also to assert their racial identities, despite physical and historical evidence to the contrary. If a man with male anatomy and a “Y” chromosome can assert he is female and be put on the covers of celebrity magazines and given awards for bravery, why can’t a white woman assert that her internal identity is that of a black woman?

If a blond man with Scandinavian roots visits Japan and feels a gripping sense of belonging, such that he is certain he is among his own people, why can’t that man return to America, dye his hair, have facial surgery and be accepted as an Asian-American?

Why does factual history have to dictate current reality if a human being feels very deeply that that factual history is not in tune with his or her inner sense of self?

I mean the question sincerely, because we are rushing into this philosophical and psychological landscape with almost no consideration of its implications. And I am not taking sides with either transgender advocates or those who oppose them. Let others consider the implications of the transgender movement for our collective grip on reality, as a culture and as a species.

I am merely stating what seems obvious to me. If our measure of what a person is must be no more and no less than what she feels she is, then Rachel Dolezal can be black, if she wants to be, and if she can show evidence that she has sincerely adopted that vision of herself. And Elizabeth Warren can be a Native American. To do otherwise would be to stigmatize them for their “racial identity,” in the same way that Caitlyn Jenner would object to being stigmatized for Caitlyn’s “gender identity.”

Racial identity need not be the end of this, by the way. Here’s one to ponder: If a man feels, to the core of his being, that he is 65 when he is chronologically 35, and if he can show evidence that he has voiced this self-concept, repeatedly, and has objected vigorously to being treated as though he is 35, who are we to lace him to his actual date of birth? Why not let him choose another that feels “right”? And if he applies for Medicare, why should he be denied? Isn’t that discriminating against him based on his age identity?

You may think this is ridiculous (and I might), but a leading attorney with whom I have consulted has suggested that the case of such a man would not be without some merit, given the case law regarding transgender individuals.

As my artist friend Lincoln Agner puts it, “When we cross enough boundaries, millions of people can end up playing air guitar.”

I have warned and warned and warned that breaking free of certain apparent realities that define us as human beings – genetically and historically – can have profound implications for how closely people remain tied to reality, in general. Let us see how far down this path of “self”-assertion we travel, and with what results.

22663, Dulles Airport ERUPTS As Detained Family Reunites After Trump’s Muslim Ban (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s Muslim ban was one of the main focal points in his presidential campaign, but no one imagined that he d actually follow through with it so quickly after officially becoming President.Trump s first week in office was marked by several inhumane executive orders, one of which involved banning refugees from seven predominately Muslim countries. As a result, on Saturday travelers to the U.S. were humiliated and detained for up to 12 hours at airports across the country, receiving word that they could not come into America as their relatives waited anxiously to hear what would happen. It is a disgusting ordeal to put a family through, and signifies the breakdown of the U.S. Constitution under Trump s administration.Fortunately, people like Trump are not the majority. In response to this disgusting ban, thousands of protesters gathered at airports around the country to fight for the rights of the citizens being detained. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and volunteer lawyers got to work, offering their services pro bono to aide the detainees, and last night America finally saw its first win against Trump s tyranny.Brooklyn Federal Judge Ann Donnelly slapped the law down on Trump and was able to enact a nationwide temporary emergency block to Trump s Muslim ban, relieving these families and citizens from their anguish. ACLU Executive Director Anthony D. Romero responded to the ruling: Clearly the judge understood the possibility for irreparable harm to hundreds of immigrants and lawful visitors to this country. Our courts today worked as they should as bulwarks against government abuse or unconstitutional policies and orders. On week one, Donald Trump suffered his first loss in court. If you want to see just how monumental this was, you don t have to look any further than the outpouring of emotion that happened at Dulles Airport in North Virginia, after the Federal Judge granted travelers stay. In a crowd of over 1,000 people, a family reunited for the first time after authorities detained a woman due to Trump s Muslim ban. You can watch the powerful moment below:Amazing, emotional scenes here at Dulles as some passengers finally unite with crying relatives surrounded by protestors welcoming them. pic.twitter.com/h8sW3LR75N  (((YousefMunayyer))) (@YousefMunayyer) January 29, 2017We must never forget that what Trump is doing is not only cruel and ruining people s lives, but it is unconstitutional.

6272,"Obama's last State of the Union address in three words: Disjointed, irrelevant and disappointing","As a long time observer of the political process and as someone who served twice in the White House, I remember the great anticipation for past State of the Union speeches.  It was an activity where many hundreds of hours and top level staff worked on the speech for many months before it was delivered. It was to be a recap of what had been accomplished and an agenda for the future.

I remember the excitement of the president going to Capitol Hill to address the nation, standing before the other branches of the government, the Congress and the Supreme Court, and either inspiring or informing all of just what the title states: this is the State of the Union.

Part of the drama has been the grand entrance into the people's House, the House of a Representatives and the president being mobbed by members trying to shake his hand or pat his back and for this one night he is treated like a rock star or to be more current like a reality TV star.

The repeated standing and applauding for the key phrases that appeal to the partisans in his party and the negative responses from the opposition.

Everyone is there!

Anyone  of importance in our government along with  the ambassador contingent  from the diplomatic community, is there on display for the nation to see.

This has historically been an opportunity for  a dramatic speech to the nation and the world and without question as important as any that a president might deliver. Tuesday night was the last of these that President Barack Obama will ever give.

As I watched the visuals, the new young Speaker, Paul Ryan, sitting alongside the vice president whom he tried to replace in the last election.  Biden, realizing daily that this is his last hurrah -- and privately telling people he wishes he would have run one more time against the faltering Hillary Clinton.

Speaker Ryan, who now holds more power than anyone except maybe the lame duck president, sits in a seat he never anticipated a year ago. He will be the one who sets the legislative agenda for the future and the president’s only retort is his veto pen.

I watch the one Socialist member of Congress, Senator Bernie Sanders mix and greet the members of the Joint Chief of Staffs of our military, with their stars on their uniforms and rows of medals on their chests.

There is not a member in this chamber who would ever have thought a year ago that Sanders would be viewed as a serious challenger to Hillary Clinton, as he now is.

For someone as skilled at giving a speech as our forty-fourth president, Mr. Obama failed miserably at either inspiring or informing us of the real State of the Union.

What he did do is give a political campaign speech. It was disjointed, irrelevant and disappointing. He is not running for a third term and the agenda he laid out is not what the country wants or feels. He looked tired and ready to move on.

He talked about how great we are as a nation. True,  but what he didn't do was set an agenda for his final year or for his legacy.

He set goals but failed to explain how we can accomplish them. He talked about leadership but has failed miserably as a leader.

On the very day the president is delivered his speech, the Iranian Navy captured two US Navy ships that allegedly were incapacitated and drifted into Iranian waters. Now Iran is holding these sailors hostage. Yet, there was no mention of this incident in the president’s speech.

This is an escalation of hostile behavior by the Iranians who just last month fired unguided missiles at our aircraft carrier , the Harry S. Truman, in the same waters.

I can't imagine, if he was still with us, that President Truman would disregard these acts of hostility. He was a man of strength. With the country feeling that terrorism is one of our top problems, the president dismissed our concerns. Don't worry! We've got the strongest military in the world. We got Bin Laden.

This is what he said about Iran: ""That’s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. As we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.""

I don't think so. Bad behavior by Iran is dismissed because President Obama wants to protect his sacred and risky deal.

The number one concern of the country is fighting terrorism. The recent home grown action by the terrorist killings in San Bernardino, California has made this more of a concern. But in spite of this, just this week the president is to release more prisoners from Guantanamo. It is still his top priority to close this prison in spite of strong objections from the Congress, the military and law enforcement officers.

Many of the prisoners already released have returned to the terrorist battlefield. ""That is why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo: it’s expensive, it’s unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies.""

This is a speech that will not be remembered and will historically be irrelevant.

The man who was the most partisan president in recent history, talked about how disappointed he is that the partisan divide  has not healed.

The office of the presidency has been diminished under Barack Obama’s two terms. His party has been demolished at the State house level and in the loss of both Houses of Congress. But he still panders on.

This is not an historic presidency and he exemplified his ""leading from behind"" with a very forgettable farewell State of the Union.

No wonder the country is desperately looking for new leadership.

9949,Reviving ‘The Mikado’ in a Balancing Act of Taste - The New York Times,"One of the most passionately debated stage works of our time is a    operetta. Is Gilbert and Sullivan’s enduringly popular “The Mikado” a droll satire of Victorian England? A racist caricature of Japan? Some amalgam of the two? Recent revivals have ended up in the cross hairs of these questions, sparking protests across the nation, along with earnest wondering about how  —   and even if  —   this 1885 piece should be staged in the 21st century. When an outcry arose last year over a planned revival of the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players’ old production  —   which had featured a mostly white cast in yellowface makeup, and employed some ugly stereotypes to evoke the imaginary Japanese town of Titipu  —   the company initially responded by saying that it would scrap the makeup. Then, realizing that the complications were more than skin deep, it decided to scrap the entire staging and take a year to rethink its approach, diversify its cast and create a new show. The result will open on Wednesday at Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College in Manhattan. Finding the right balance is not easy: Some of the most severe critics of “The Mikado” find it too inherently offensive to be performed, while some ardent fans view any changes as bows to excessive political correctness. Shortly after the New York company announced it was replacing last year’s “Mikado” with “The Pirates of Penzance,” David Wannen, its executive director, received a letter from a   pirate who complained that he was offended that the troupe did not plan to cast real pirates. David Auxier, the director of the new “Mikado” production, recalled that “Sometimes the conversation got to be: ‘You’re never going to please everybody, so why try? ’” He added: “I said, ‘We’re starting from the understanding that we’re never going to please everybody. But we’re still going to try. ’” As the use of yellowface  —   which can refer not only to makeup, but to broader attempts at racial impersonation or caricature  —   has drawn protests at “Mikado” revivals from Seattle to New York, companies presenting it have responded with a variety of approaches. A   2013 staging by Skylark Opera and Mu Performing Arts in St. Paul inverted the libretto, setting the piece in England and casting   actors in key roles. This year, the Lamplighters Music Theater in San Francisco decided not to set its new production in Japan after local   performers threatened protests. Instead it moved the action to Renaissance Italy and changed the opening line from “If you want to know who we are, we are gentlemen of Japan” to “If you want to know who we are, we are gentlemen of Milan. ” A production by the   Gilbert and Sullivan Players this fall was set in a 1960s   hotel in Las Vegas to, as the organizers put it, “recontextualize the origins of the show in Japonisme and commodity racism. ” It still drew protests. In New York, emotions have run high on all sides. A Save the Mikado NYC Facebook page sprang up, calling for the operetta “to be performed exactly as conceived by Gilbert and Sullivan, with only a very small number of minor alterations that have been standard for over half a century. ” Another Facebook group, Artists Against The Mikado, was “dedicated to the controversial idea that minstrel shows where white people dress up as fake Japanese is a little out of date. ” The old “Mikado” production had used yellowface, and the troupe had invented a minor role, played by a child, that was credited as a “coolie,” which company officials said they had not realized was a slur. A 2004 version of the staging included “a man with a Fu Manchu mustache and impossibly long fingernails,” Josephine Lee, a professor of English and   Studies at the University of Minnesota, writes in her influential 2010 book, “The Japan of Pure Invention: Gilbert and Sullivan’s ‘The Mikado,’” which traces the work’s long, complex racial history. In an interview, Ms. Lee questioned the commonly heard defense that “The Mikado” should not be considered racist because it is meant in fun. “There are lots of instances in blackface minstrelsy that are lighthearted and funny  —   and also offensive,” she said. Before mounting their new “Mikado,” the New Yorkers sought advice, listened to critics and sent out casting calls that stressed a desire for diversity. At a forum held in November at the Kaye Playhouse, Jonathan Jenkins Ichikawa, a professor of philosophy at the University of British Columbia who has performed in Gilbert and Sullivan works, noted that many of the most offensive elements of recent productions were invented by stage directors. “You don’t need to do a lot of violence to the work to not tape actor’s eyes back to make their eyes look ‘slanty,’” he said, recalling productions he had appeared in that did just that. So the New York company set about trying to strip away those elements. Like Mike Leigh’s 1999 film “” which told the story of Gilbert and Sullivan as they created “The Mikado,” the new production will firmly establish the operetta as a work of the Victorian imagination. A new prologue features the composer and librettist planning their next opera and admiring some Japanese objects. When a sword falls, knocking Gilbert unconscious, he dreams “The Mikado” proper, set in an imaginary Japan as conceived by a   Englishman. The production will emphasize the work’s satire of Victorian mores, and do away with racially charged performance tics and excessive bowing and shuffling in its choreography. While the ensemble would never be mistaken for, say, the multicultural cast of “Hamilton,” it is the troupe’s most diverse yet. Erin Quill, an   actress, wrote about the controversy last year on her lively blog, The Fairy Princess Diaries. Ms. Quill, who spoke at the company’s forum in November, said in an interview that she was “cautiously optimistic” about the new production. “Am I glad this conversation is happening?” she asked. “Absolutely. Do I wish this conversation had been 20 years ago? Of course. ”",0
3528,Kejriwal in talks with Dr Manmohan Singh to become AAP’s Punjab CM candidate,"Kejriwal in talks with Dr Manmohan Singh to become AAP’s Punjab CM candidate Posted on Tweet (Image via intoday.in) 
Dr Manmohan Singh is back with a bang and how!! After his hard-hitting speech in Parliament in which Dr Singh blasted the Modi regime’s demonetization drive, the former Prime Minister is being wooed by none other than Arvind Kejriwal to become AAP’s Punjab CM candidate. If Dr Singh takes the bait, political pundits opine that it could bolster AAP’s chances of grabbing power in Punjab. 
AAP has been criticized for not naming its CM candidate thus far. Kejriwal is also being painted as an outsider who wants to willy-nilly become Punjab CM after handing over Delhi to Sisodiya. Kejri on the other hand is reluctant to name a CM candidate. That would create a rival power center and Kejri understandably doesn’t want a repeat of the Yogendra Yadav-Prashant Bhushan fiasco . 
Who can Kejri trust? Naming someone from his coteries is a non-starter – Announcing The Ashutosh as CM candidate would ensure that AAP candidates would lose their deposit in all the seats. Sanjay Singh’s tharki ways make Bill Clinton look like a priest. And even Hafiz Saeed is more popular than Ashish Khetan in Punjab. 
To make matters worse, after months of intense negotiations, Sidhu has ditched AAP and hitched his bandwagon to the Congress. The signs aren’t good – TrollKejri gets more RTs than Kejri, Sardesai is back to wooing Sonia, even Rahul seems to be edging ahead. And that’s why announcing Dr Manmohan Singh as AAP’s Punjab CM candidate is, to paraphrase the great Shastri, ‘just what the doctor ordered’. For one, AAP’s CM candidate will be a true blue Punjabi, a Sikh, and that too a former PM!! On the other hand, Kejri can go to sleep easy with the remote control firmly in his hand. In fact, by adopting the 10 Janpath formula of diarchy, Kejri can continue to wield power in both Punjab and Delhi, while having the time and space for Vipasna sessions in Bengaluru, Friday movie reviews and campaigning in Goa. It’s a win-win deal. 
Insiders say Sonia has agreed to let Kejri borrow Dr Manmohan Singh. To defeat Modi in 2019, AAP needs to come to power in Punjab in 2017. And for that, Sonia is willing to lose Punjab. So under the new arrangement, Dr Singh will report to Kejriwal as well as Sonia. 
However, Dr Singh has placed a few conditions of his own before transferring allegiance to Kejriwal. One, Monty must be made Deputy Chairman of the Punjab Planning Commission. Two, Dr Singh must be given complete freedom in formulating Punjab’s 5 year plans. Three, he will not be required to campaign during the polls. 
Kejriwal has accepted these conditions. Looks like Indian politics is all set to enter a new epoch.",1

44677,"Russia revels in Trump victory, looks to sanctions relief","MOSCOW (Reuters) - For all their mutual praise, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are likely to disagree on many things. But Trump’s election win could hand Moscow an elusive prize - the lifting or easing of Western sanctions. Rolling back those sanctions, imposed by the United States and the European Union to punish Moscow for its 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, could spur investment in Russia’s flat-lining economy. That might make it even easier for Putin, who is trying to plug holes in the state budget inflicted by low oil prices and sanctions, to win a fourth presidential term in 2018 by allowing him to show he has returned the economy to growth.  “Clearly the chances of sanctions being lifted on Russia have risen substantially,” Charles Robertson, Renaissance Capital’s global chief economist, said. “That would improve the investment climate for Russia.” Russia’s rouble currency and stocks gained on the Trump election victory. Ukraine’s dollar-denominated bonds tumbled to multi-month lows, reflecting pessimism about what a Trump presidency means for the divided and indebted country. The Kremlin had been bracing for fraught relations if the White House had been won by Hillary Clinton - a politician Putin once accused of stirring up protests against him and who state media portrayed as an anti-Russian warmonger. Trump was portrayed in a more positive light. Putin described him as “very talented” and in Kremlin-backed media he was cast as a plucky political maverick. Still, few in Moscow had believed the Republican candidate would win, apart from a group of Trump-supporting nationalists who gathered in a Moscow bar decorated with a triptych of Putin, Trump and French Front National leader Marine Le Pen. Once it became clear he had won, Russia’s parliament erupted in applause and Putin told foreign ambassadors he was ready to fully restore ties with Washington. State TV ran a clip of a Russian doppelganger of Trump taunting a cowed Clinton lookalike and Margarita Simonyan, the boss of RT, the Kremlin’s English-language TV news channel, said she would drive around Moscow with a U.S. flag to celebrate. But Russian glee was tempered by a recognition that Trump’s pre-election promises might be diluted and that deep contradictions between Moscow and Washington would remain, even if Trump and Putin adopt a friendly tone in public. Trump’s attempts to ease restrictions on doing business with Russia could also be constrained by Congress, which has shown it has little patience for the Kremlin’s military adventures. Executives with Western firms say the biggest obstacle to deals with Russia is not the sanctions themselves but the prospect that more could be imposed and the zeal with which existing sanctions are enforced. If a Trump White House were to send a signal to businesses that it was taking a more lax approach, investments could start flowing again with sanctions still in place. A softer U.S. stance could also weaken European sanctions resolve. The bloc’s measures have already started to look wobbly, with some member states finding ways to circumvent them, others saying it is time to discuss moving on, and some business groups in countries such as Germany lobbying against them. Until now, Washington has helped stiffen European resolve. When Russia placed a Eurobond in May this year, many European banks decided not to take part because they did not want to fall foul of U.S. financial regulators. “America was the leader there and amazingly has been able to hold Europe together (on sanctions),” political analyst Masha Lipman told Reuters. “With Donald Trump in the White House I think there may be changes, something that might be beneficial for Russia.” Putin needs sanctions lifted as they risk hurting his re-election prospects. Russia’s central bank is forecasting economic growth of up to 1 percent next year, well below the level Russian households have come to expect. After previous slumps, recoveries have been driven by foreign lending and investment. There are already some signs that the economy is hurting support for Putin, a trend that is only likely to grow in the 18 months until the Russian presidential election. Kremlin-watchers said that, even if U.S.-relations were less antagonistic with Trump in the White House, any deal would involve hard bargaining on both sides. Russia is seeking formal recognition from the world that Crimea, part of Ukraine, is now Russian territory, something it has only got so far apart from a handful of nations. It also wants Kiev to do more to implement a peace deal covering eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists hold sway. In Syria, where Russia is helping President Bashar al-Assad fight a war with air strikes and military assistance, Moscow wants the West to drop ideas about changing the government, abandon help for what it says are hardline Islamists, and drop talk of possible no-fly zones. One possibility is a quid pro quo, with Russia making concessions on Syria in exchange for the United States ceding ground on Ukraine and sanctions. “For Russia the key point is Ukraine. If Trump says that America does not care about Ukraine, then that is all that Russia wants to hear right now,” Georgy Bovt, editor of the Russkiy Mir magazine, told Reuters. “On Syria it will be easier to reach a deal. I think that on Assad, Russia will be willing to compromise because Ukraine is more important for Russia.” Much has been made in Russian and Western media of the perceived similarities and differences between Putin and Trump, who have never met. Both are fond of tough talking and some Russian politicians have suggested the pair might be able to forge a close working relationship similar to the one the Russian leader enjoyed with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.  Trump has said he might even meet Putin before his inauguration. Putin’s spokesman said there were currently no plans for such a meeting.   People familiar with both men’s leadership styles advised caution however, saying both were relatively thin-skinned when it came to criticism. Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, a think-tank close to the Foreign Ministry, told Reuters the fact that Trump was an untested politician would also be a worry for the Kremlin. “He’s a loose cannon and you never know what to expect from him,” he said. There were also concerns the two men might be too alike.  “The problem is that both of them, Putin and Trump, are macho,” Sergei Markov, a Kremlin-connected analyst and former pro-Putin lawmaker, told Reuters. “They could try to take the measure of each other. We can’t let that happen.” ",0
40486,Illinois governor orders special session to break budget impasse,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois’ Republican governor, Bruce Rauner, has ordered lawmakers to return to work starting next Wednesday to pass a budget as the clock ticks down to the July 1 start of a new fiscal year. But there is no sign in the Democratic-led legislature that a breakthrough in the 23-month impasse could be imminent. Rauner warned on Thursday that the inability to pass a budget could bring “devastating and long-lasting ramifications” for the nation’s fifth-largest state. Those include possible “junk” credit ratings, a halt to state-funded road projects, and suspension from national lotteries. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of an unprecedented second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to an impasse between Rauner and Democratic leaders.  Rauner said he would sign into law a bill package unveiled by Republican legislators on Wednesday that includes a $36 billion budget, a school funding revamp, and several measures he has sought such as a local property tax freeze, term limits for top state officials and cost-saving changes to the system that compensates injured workers. The bills require three-fifths majority votes for passage instead of a simple majority. “It is a true compromise – and one I hope the majority in the General Assembly will accept,” the governor said in a Facebook video posted on Thursday. Rauner and Democrats continued to blame each other for the budget crisis. “House Democrats will continue our work on the budget from Springfield, but as Governor Rauner has met each of our attempts to date with refusal, it’s clear that the onus is on the governor to show that he is finally serious about working in good faith to end the crisis he has manufactured,” House Speaker Michael Madigan said in a statement. If Illinois still lacks a budget when the new fiscal year dawns, the consequences could be big. The state’s credit ratings could sink to “junk,” a first for any U.S. state, leaving some investors unable to buy the state’s debt and others to demand even fatter yields. The state will be suspended from participating in the Powerball and Mega Millions lotteries due to the lack of fiscal 2018 appropriations to pay winning ticket holders, Illinois Lottery spokesman Jason Schaumburg said. The games have generated about $240 million in sales in Illinois so far in fiscal 2017. With no money to pay road contractors, Illinois’ transportation department is shutting down about 700 ongoing projects that carry a price tag of $2.3 billion, according to department spokeswoman Gianna Urgo. The budget impasse has ballooned Illinois’ pile of unpaid bills to $15 billion as of Wednesday, fueling litigation by unpaid vendors and others. A U.S. judge has set a June 20 deadline for Illinois to start paying more of the $2 billion it owes Medicaid providers. ",0
